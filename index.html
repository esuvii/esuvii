        <h2>0. Preface</h2>
        <h3 id="preface-goal">0.1 The Goal of This Guide</h3>
        <p>The novelty of a Warlock tank has made Twin Emps highly discussed. However, in my experience, it is by far the most consistent and easy role in the fight. That said, it is incredibly fun!</p>
        <p>The primary goal of this guide is to coach anyone to be capable of performing the role in Hardcore, even if they have zero prior experience with AQ40 in any capacity. It provides a <a href="#stepbystep">step-by-step explanation</a> of how to perform the fight, as well as everything you need to know to prepare ahead of time.</p>
        <p>The nature of Hardcore demands consistent strategies that work on the first try. For that reason, the same strategies can be applied by non-Hardcore (softcore) guilds who are progressing the raid. It is not the task of this guide to discuss parse strategies, instead aiming for an extremely simple, repeatable, methodology with as little movement and intricacy as possible.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are several non-trivial questions on which I hope to share my knowledge. In particular the matters of <a href="#pushback">spell pushback mitigation</a>, and Vek'lor's <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>. The latter of which is still not fully understood.</p>

        <h3 id="preface-about">0.2 About the Author</h3>
        <p>Who is esuvii? In short, I love HC WoW and my favourite class is Warlock! I played Warlock through 2019 Classic, TBC and WotLK. In mid-late 2020, I first tried Hardcore, largely inspired by watching B0aty play HCIM OSRS I attempted (and succeeded) to level a HC Hunter to 60. Later I began to actively play as a member of the Classic Hardcore community, and in November 2021 I joined the HC Road to Ragnaros event in Season of Mastery. Ever since then I've been raiding as a Warlock in HC Elite.</p>
        <p>As of writing this, I've played Warlock on Twins Emps a minimum of:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>32 times in softcore.</li>
        	<li>12 times in unofficial HC on BSB (including the first ever clear).</li>
        	<li>73 times in official HC on Defias Pillager (including the world first official clear).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During this time I have coached several Warlocks to tank Twins in HC, including those with zero experience.</p>
        <p><strong>We have NEVER had a Warlock tank die on Twins.</strong></p>
        <p>Through HC I have tanked in a BWL level SR set, absolute BiS SR gear, fresh 60 + crafted SR gear, and one time when I forgot to equip SR gear.</p>
        <p><em>While there is no single highest authority on this fight, I believe there is a strong case that I have the most HC experience.</em></p>
    </section>

    
    <section id="basics">
    	<h2>1. The Basics</h2>
    	<p>Twin Emperors, as the name suggests, is a fight with two bosses: Vek'lor (caster boss), and Vek'nilash (melee boss). It is a required boss, situated after Huhuran, and opens the door which leads to Ouro and C'thun.</p>
    	<figure id="fig1">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/boss-room.jpg" alt="The boss room, Vek'lor back-left, Vek'nilash back-right.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 1: The Twin Emps boss room.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Here we see the boss starting positions, <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. You will either be the "left side" or "right side" Warlock tank, and will stay within those areas. We'll see this in much more detail in the <a href="#positioning">Positioning</a> section.</p>
    	<p>The fight typically lasts between 3 to 5 minutes. It is not a DPS race, the enrage (Berserk) timer is 15 minutes - you must kill the bosses in this time, but that should not be an issue. Vek'lor and Vek'nilash share a percentage health pool, damage to one will hurt the other, so it is okay if your raid is heavily skewed towards magical or physical damage.</p>
    	<p>The final shared mechanic is Heal Brother. If the bosses are within 60 yds they will spam heal each other for 300k per cast. This is why we tank them on opposite sides of the room.</p>

    	<h3 id="basics-teleport">1.1 Twin Teleport</h3>
    	<p>The most fundamental mechanic of this fight is the Twin Teleport. Perodically the bosses will Teleport, swapping positions. All Threat is reset, and whoever is closest to a boss will gain 2000 Threat for that boss. While you are waiting (AFK Phase), i.e. Vek'nilash is on your side, you must ensure you are ready to begin tanking Vek'lor immediately after the Teleport.</p>
    	<figure id="fig2">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/DBM-teleport.jpg" alt="Example DBM timer for Twin Teleport.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 2: An example DBM timer for the Twin Teleport.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>The Teleport timing is random, and <em>will</em> happen any time during a ~11 second window, starting ~29s after the previous Teleport. DBM's data suggests the earliest Teleport (window open) is after ~29.2s and the latest is ~40.2s (window closes). <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, shows how my DBM timer looks for the Twin Teleport. The transparent part of the timer represents the time until the Teleport window opens, and the highlighted portion on the right side is the maximum possible duration of the window.</p>
    	<figure id="fig3">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/DBM-settings.jpg" alt="My DBM timer settings.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 3: My DBM timer settings.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Depending on how your DBM is configured, or if you are using a different addon such as BigWigs, your timer may look different. In <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> you can see how I configured my timer to countdown until the window opens, instead of the default of until it would close. This is down to personal preference, and the way addons look is likely to change in the future.</p>
    	<p>When they Teleport it is imperative that all DPS are away from the bosses, and have no large DoTs (e.g. Ignite) rolling. This can result in the bosses moving, and possibly killing people.</p>

    	<h3 id="basics-veklor">1.2 Vek'lor</h3>
    	<p>Emperor Vek'lor is the caster boss; he is immune to all physical damage. This is the boss we Warlock tank. While it is <e>technically</e> possible for other classes to tank him (e.g. a Paladin spamming GBoK), we will not cover that - Warlock is by far the safest choice.</p>

    	<h3 id="basics-veknilash">1.3 Vek'nilash</h3>
    	<p>Emperor Vek'nilash is the melee boss; he is immune to all magic damage (except Holy). For completeness I will list his abilities, however it is the Warrior tank on your side's job to tank him. We should never have to interact with Vek'nilash.</p>

				</div>
			</div>

    	<h3 id="basics-roles">1.4 Roles</h3>
    	<p>For the strategy presented here we require:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>2 Warrior tanks, one for each side to tank Vek'nilash.</li>
    		<li>2 Warlock tanks, one for each side to tank Vek'lor.</li>
    		<li>Someone to pull Vek'nilash at the start of the fight, ideally a Hunter.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>You will also have healers split between the left/right sides.</p>
    	<p>While it is possible to tank Twins with a single Warlock, situated in the middle of the room and swapping sides, I will not cover it here. That setup is not recommended, since our goal is a consistent and safe strategy.</p>
    	<p><em>Note that throughout this guide I refer to "Warrior tanks" to distinguish them from the Warlock tank, however it is possible for a geared Feral Druid to tank Vek'nilash instead of a Warrior.</em></p>
    </section>

    <section id="stepbystep">
    	<h2>2. Step-By-Step Tanking a Phase</h2>
    	<p>In this section we will cover your rotation, and how to handle a tanking phase. For where to stand, with annotated images, and example videos of tanking left/right side, please see the <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a> section.</p>
    	<p>Before the fight begins please double check:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Your SR set is equipped.</li>
    		<li>You have Prayer of Shadow Protection, with at least 6 minutes left.</li>
    		<li>You have Gift of Arthas, GAPP, GFrPP, and GFFP. We will discuss these consumables in more detail in the <a href="#consumables">Consumable List</a> section.</li>
    		<li>Blessing of Salvation is removed (Alliance only).</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>To remove Salv I use the following macro:</p>
    	<div class="code-block"><pre><code>/cancelaura Blessing of Salvation
/cancelaura Greater Blessing of Salvation</code></pre></div>
    	<p>Some people like to include this in one of their ability macros, however personally I just have it on my bars and manually click it a few times before the pull.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-preteleport">2.1 Pre-Teleport</h3>
    	<p>Let's start from before Vek'lor teleports to you. The Warrior on your side is tanking Vek'nilash and you are waiting for the Teleport. There is no need to rush, you have around 20-30s to prepare before the next phase:</p>
    	<ol>
    		<li>Life Tap back to full mana. It takes approximately 4000 mana to tank each phase, so you should <strong>NEVER Life Tap while tanking Vek'lor</strong>. You can do this now, during your AFK phase.</li>
    		<li>Stand in the correct place (see <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a>), you may have to adjust a little.</li>
    		<li>Before the window opens cast Shadow Ward. This will help with mitigation for the first Shadow Bolt you recieve after taking aggro of Vek'lor.</li>
    		<li>Ensure you have <strong>Vek'lor</strong> targeted. Remember, this boss is currently on the opposite side.</li>
    		<li>Before the Teleport window opens start spamming Searing Pain. This ensures you begin your cast as soon as possible after Teleport.</li>
    	</ol> 
    	<h3 id="stepbystep-teleport">2.2 Teleport</h3>
    	<p>Vek'lor has teleported and you should have immediately started casting Searing Pain. Assuming DPS all left before the Teleport, the Warrior will have ~2.1k Threat on Vek'lor - this is the initial Threat that the closest player gets (modified by Defensive Stance). The boss be inactive for ~1.5s, during this the Warrior should immediately run out to a similar distance as you.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Keep casting Searing Pain.</li>
    		<li>Vek'lor should not move, and will begin casting Shadow Bolts on the Warrior tank. This is normal. It is okay for the Warrior to take 2-3 Shadow Bolts before you are top Threat - your healers will be prepared for this.</li>
    		<li>After 3-4 casts you should overtake the Warrior and be the top Threat.</li>
    		<li>Keep casting Searing Pain.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>If Vek'lor starts running at you, or the Warrior, or casts Arcane Burst, he may be in Melee Mode. If everyone is follows the strategy this is extremely rare, however please see the <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>section for some suggestions about how to handle it.</p>
    	<figure id="fig4">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/resist-wa.webp" alt="My Searing Pain Resist WA.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 4: My Searing Pain resist WeakAura.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>I use a WeakAura that I wrote to announce in /yell if my Searing Pain resists when casting on Vek'lor. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> shows how it looks. It is not required, but it is useful for indicating to the healers that you are having a tough time overcoming the initial Threat of the Warrior tank. You can import it here: <a href="https://wago.io/Qvo4g9stE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vek'lor Searing Pain Resist</a></p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-explode">2.3 Explode Bug</h3>
    	<p>Vek'lor will periodically cast Explode Bug. A fire animation will appear on the exploding bug, before it grows in size and then explodes. <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> shows this fire animation.</p>
    	<figure id="fig5">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/bug-on-fire.jpg" alt="A Scorpion about to explode.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 5: A Scorpion targeted by Explode Bug.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>At this point you have a few options, and must make a judgement call:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>Tank the Explosion:</strong> If the bug is too close, or you can't avoid it due to the wall or Blizzard, you can ignore it and take the damage. If your GFPP is fully active you should absorb most of it.</li>
    		<li><strong>Move:</strong> If the bug is not right on top of you then you may be able to move to avoid it.</li>
    		<li><strong>Death Coil:</strong> RNG option to make the bug move away from you. This requires quick reactions, and swapping targets, so I do not advise it for your first time tanking Twins.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<figure id="fig6">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/circle-move.jpg" alt="A circular path around Vek'lor.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 6: An example path for avoiding mechanics.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>If you are moving away from the bug, it is important you follow an arc that keeps your distance to Vek'lor fixed. If you move out of his range he will chase you triggering Melee Mode. If you move too close he may enter Melee Mode and Arcane Burst you. <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> shows the circular path around Vek'lor that you should restrict your movement to. If you are in range, while moving you could Shadowburn to compensate for the lost casts. However, this is likely unnecessary unless someone is close on Threat.</p>
    	<p>If you take the explosion damage, and your health drops low you can use your Healthstone. This is particularly useful if you are facing multiple mechanics at once, for example Blizzard and Explode Bug and a Shadow Bolt from Vek'lor. Keep in mind that your GFPP is now gone. You can either pop a new GFPP or save your potion CD. If you choose to save your potion CD, be ready to drink a GFPP if another Explode Bug is nearby - before you take damage from it.</p>
    	<figure id="vid1">
    		<div class="video-responsive">
    			<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFGrPIrx5kQ?si=yn42wBphCT4bxG3l" title="Explode Bug Death Coil" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    		</div>
		    <figcaption>Video 1: Using Death Coil to avoid Explode Bug.</figcaption>
		</figure>
    	<p>Using Death Coil is a more advanced play. It has to be a quick reaction, and it is inconsistent due to the random direction the bug will move. However, it can be a useful tool if you cannot move, and pulling it off will make those who see it consider you a pro-gamer. <a href="#vid1">Video 1</a> shows me performing the Death Coil.</p>
    	<p>A good healer will notice you are about to take Explode Bug or Blizzard damage and start a big heal or Power Word: Shield you. A call of <em>"big heals on me"</em> or a healer saying <em>"big heals on your-name"</em> is great to ensure everyone knows the damage is coming.</p>
  		<p>The Warrior tank is AFK for most of this phase. If they are experienced with the fight they will kill the Scarabs/Scorpions around you, so that none are near enough to explode on you. Be aware that they do respawn.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-blizzard">2.4 Blizzard</h3>
    	<p>Unlike Explode Bug, <strong>you should NOT stay still and tank the Blizzard</strong>. It ticks for ~1500 Frost damage. Your GFrPP will mitigate the first, and <em>maybe</em> the second, tick. You should move as discussed before, see <a href="#fig5">Figure 6</a>, to ensure you are a consistent distance from Vek'lor.</p>
    	<p>It is not impossible to tank the Blizzard, but know you will be taking ~8000 damage over 10s (5 ticks). If you absolutely must stay in it, wait for your active GFrPP to be used up then pop another one. You will need really big heals during this time, and I really do not recommend it unless there is no other option. Remember you have Healthstone if you are taking a lot of damage.</p>
    	<p><strong>Blizzard always spawns on a player.</strong> This is why in <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a> we will see that we are away from the DPS stack. This greatly reduces the chance it spawns on us. However, you may catch the edge of a Blizzard that has spawned on the Warrior tank or a healer.</p>

		<p>In <a href="#vid2">Video 2</a> you see an example of me moving out of Blizzard. We get the worst RNG here and an Explode Bug happens right where I move towards. I choose to tank the explosion since I consider avoiding the Blizzard a higher priority.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-doom">2.5 Curse of Doom</h3>
    	<p>A bonus tool to help with initial Threat is Curse of Doom. Due to the variation of Teleport timings, it is not going to work consistently. The idea is to cast Doom while tanking Vek'lor, and it will pop during your <em>next</em> tanking phase.</p>
    	<figure id="fig7">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/doom.jpg" alt="Curse of Doom applied.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 7: An example Curse of Doom.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>The timing is not perfect, and it will take trial and error. <strong>I have found that casting around 20s before the Teleport window opens (~10s after the boss appears) works well</strong>, see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.</p>
    	<p><strong>If you cast a little early</strong>, it will simply pop near the end of the other Warlock's tanking phase. That Warlock should have a lot of Threat, so there is no risk.</p>
    	<p><strong>If you cast a little late</strong> it will still pop on your side, but it will be later into the tanking phase. This still boosts your Threat, but you likely already have a comfortable lead at that point.</p>
    	<p>If my 20s timing isn't working, I recommend trying ~17/18s before the Teleport window opens. You can then gradually be greedier (earlier) as you get a feel for it.</p>
    	<p>If Curse of Doom resists, or it is your final tanking phase, you can cast Curse of the Elements. This marginally helps both you and the opposite side Warlock overcome the 2k initial Threat. However, it will not always change the number of Searing Pain casts required to overtake the Warrior. You can also just use Elements if you don't want to have to think about Curse of Doom - just make sure you have a Threat lead before initially applying it.</p>
    	<p>If you have a 3rd Warlock (a non-tank), you likely already have Elements up. In that case, the backup would be Curse of Shadow. Often Mages will swap to Arcane Missiles to ensure Ignite falls before the Twin Teleport. It is minor, but it does increase that damage.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-ending">2.6 Ending a Phase</h3>
    	<p>If you keep casting Searing Pain right up until the boss Teleports away, there is a very small chance that your final cast will land during the same 10ms spell batching window as the Teleport. If this happens, you could be top threat on Vek'lor after he appears on the opposite side. This is rare, but I have seen it a couple of times.</p>
    	<p>Once the Teleport window opens, DPS will stop (they swap sides) and you no longer need to build Threat. For safety I stop casting Searing Pain after the Teleport window opens. You can just wait for the Teleport, still avoiding mechanics of course. Keep an eye on the Threat meter to ensure there aren't any DoTs that might cause a DPS to overtake you - although this has never been an issue for me.</p>

    		<figcaption>Fig 8: The Vek'nilash tank closer to Vek'lor before Teleport.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>It is crucial that the Warrior tank is closer to the boss than you when the Teleport window opens. Otherwise you will get the initial Threat from Vek'nilash. In <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> you can see the Vek'nilash tank has moved closer than me in preparation for Teleport. It's important to pay attention to this, so you can reposition to compensate if necessary.</p>
    	<p><strong>Congratulations! You just tanked a phase! Now loop back to the start of these steps and await the next tanking phase!</strong></p>

    <section id="positioning">
    	<h2>3. Movement and Positioning</h2>
    	<p>In this section I'll show the positioning for the left/right sides, along with an explanation of the pull. This is where our strategy deviates from most common Twin Emps strategies. In many guides you are shown a Warlock kiting Vek'lor on the pull. We will not do this. Instead all boss movement is done by the Warrior tank. This eliminates two huge issues:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Kiting a caster mob to a precise location is very inconsistent.</li>
    		<li>Kiting Vek'lor requires outranging him, which in many cases forces him to enter Melee Mode.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>As you will see we require zero boss positioning from the Warlock tank, resulting in a simple and easily reproducible strategy.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-pull">3.1 The Pull</h3>
    	<p>As discussed in the <a href="#stepbystep">previous section</a>, it is crucial that you double check you have your SR set equipped, consumables popped, and Blessing of Salvation removed before the pull begins. It is the Left Warlock tank that will be pulling Vek'lor, the Right Warlock tank can be in their final tanking position before the fight begins and wait there for their tanking phase.</p>
    	<figure id="fig9">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/pull-raidplan.jpg" alt="Pre-pull positioning.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 9: The pre-pull positioning.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>In <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a> you see the pre-pull positioning. As the Left side Warlock you want to start out of Searing Pain range just before the corner of Vek'lor's staircase. I recommend at least a 10s pull timer, so that you can pull Vek'lor at the same time as the Hunter pulls Vek'linash.</p>
    	<figure id="fig10">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/staircase.jpg" alt="The corner of the staircase, ready to pull.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 10: Just in range of Searing Pain.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Once the pull timer begins:</p>
    	<ol>
    		<li>Cast Shadow Ward</li>
    		<li>Target Vek'lor</li>
    		<li>Step onto the corner of the staircase, and with ~4-5s remaining tap forwards until you see your Searing Pain icon show that it is in range. <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a> shows me on the corner of the staircase, barely in range to Searing Pain.</li>
    		<li>When the timer is at ~1s begin casting Searing Pain.</li>
    		<li>Do not kite Vek'lor, stay in position and tank this like a normal tanking phase.</li>
    	</ol>
    	<p>Over on the right side the Hunter will be timing their pull to hit Vek'nilash at approximately zero on the pull timer, the same as you. A typical pull for the Hunter might be Aimed Shot, Auto Shot, Multi-Shot; enough to hold Threat off of the healers until the Warrior tank picks up Vek'nilash. Once the Hunter has fired their combo they will immediately run backwards towards the Right Warlock, and the right side Warrior tank will run in and pickup the boss. The right side Warrior can then bring Vek'linash to the right side's final tanking position, the torch on the wall being a useful indicator.</p>
    	<p>Now the pull has begun, and Threat established, DPS will begin to attack and the Warrior tank on the left side will move closer than you to ensure the initial Threat after the first Teleport.</p>
    	<figure id="fig11">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/first-teleport.jpg" alt="The first Teleport.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 11: Positioning immediately after the first Teleport.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>, shows how the positioning will look immediately after the first Teleport:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>The Warrior tank on the left side has initial Threat on Vek'nilash and is about to bring him to the final tanking position, over by the torch.</li>
    		<li>The Left Warlock is moving back into their final tanking position.</li>
    		<li>The Right Warlock has begun their first tanking phase.</li>
    		<li>The Warrior tank on the right side is moving out of Vek'lor's melee range, immediately after the Teleport.</li>
    		<li>The Caster DPS and Melee DPS are swapping sides.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>At this point the pull phase is complete, and we are into the main stage of the fight. <strong>Notice that boss repositioning was always done by the Warrior tanking Vek'nilash, never Vek'lor.</strong> If Vek'lor gets out of position, generally you can adjust to the new position and wait for the Warrior tank to reposition during their next tanking phase.</p>
    	<p>In <a href="#vid3">Video 3</a> the Left Warlock's PoV is shown, and included in this is a demonstration of the pull.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-left">3.2 Left Side</h3>
    	<p>In <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a> we see the typical positioning of left side during their normal tanking phase (not the pull).</p>
    	<figure id="fig12">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/left-side.jpg" alt="Left side positioning.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 12: The left side positioning.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>If you are running SM/Ruin, or another spec that provides Blood Pact, you will start with your Imp on follow for the pull. After the first Teleport, while you are moving into position you can set your Imp to stay roughly mid-way between the torch (boss position) and your tanking position. This ensures both you and the Warrior tank have Blood Pact. <strong>It is crucial that your Imp stays Passive and Phase Shifted</strong>, i.e. beware your any pet attack macros.</p>

    		<figcaption>Fig 13: 1 small + 1 large tile from the boss.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>A common question is "How far should I be from Vek'lor?". The floor at the sides of the rooms is divided into alternating large plus shaped tiles, and smaller square tiles. My rule of thumb is, <strong>1 large + 1 small tile from the boss</strong>, as shown in <a href="#fig13">Figure 13.</a> You can be a touch further than this if you wish, but try not to be closer.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-right">3.3 Right Side</h3>
    	<p>The Right Warlock's positioning is a mirror image of the left side, except of course you do not do the pull. You can be in your final tanking position before the fight even begins.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-warrior">3.4 Warrior Movement</h3>
    	<p>The Warrior tank's movement is crucial on this fight. You have a good perspective on their positioning, better than they do, if something can be improved <em>gently</em> let them know - remember a Warrior's resource is Rage!</p>
    	<p><strong>Vek'nilash Teleports away:</strong> Immediately after Vek'nilash Teleports away and Vek'lor appears the Warrior must run out of melee and Arcane Burst range. Vek'lor does nothing for the first 1-2s after Teleport, this is the window they have to move. They can run to the Warlock tank as a guide. Failure to get far enough away quick enough can cause the boss to enter <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>.</p>
    	<p><strong>Teleport window opens:</strong> Before the Teleport window opens the Warrior tank must be the closest player to the boss, to get the initial Threat. That does not mean in melee range of Vek'lor. As before Vek'nilash will be inactive for the first 1-2s during which time they can run in and connect.</p>
    	<figure id="fig15">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/perpendicular.jpg" alt="A Warrior with back to the wall.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 15: A Warrior tanking with their back perfectly to the wall.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><strong>Uppercut knockback:</strong> If the Warrior tank is Uppercut right in the Teleport window then it can cause Vek'nilash to move out of position just before the Teleport happens. Even if their back is to the wall, tanking at an angle can cause them to be knocked along the wall. If a drawn line through Vek'nilash and the Warrior tank is perpendicular to the wall, then the Warrior will be knocked directly back into it and not be moved, see <a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>. This positioning is optimal.</p>
    	<p><strong>Explode Bug:</strong> While the Warlock is tanking, but prior to the Teleport window opening, the Warrior tank can kill the Scarabs/Scorpions nearby the Warlock. This greatly reduces chance of taking explosion damage.</p>

			</div>
		</div>
		<p>As stated previously, you want Gift of Arthas, GFPP, GFrPP, and GAPP all active before the fight. I do not use GSPP, since our SR gear will mitigate the Shadow Bolts. There is no harm in having a GSPP up prior to the fight, but I would never waste my potion CD on it during the fight. We Shadow Ward before a tanking phase to soften the first hit and allow healers a chance to swap targets.</p>
		<p>Additionally you want to use your standard raid consumables:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Spirit of Zanza:</strong> Lung Juice Cocktail if you don't have the rep.</li>
			<li><strong>Flask of the Titans:</strong> I recommend this for progression, or your first try on a character. After that you can judge based on how low you are getting.</li>
			<li><strong>Stamina Food:</strong> A 12 stam food, or Chimaerok Chops (25 stam) if you have access to them.</li>
			<li><strong>Rumsey Rum Black Label:</strong> ONLY IF YOU KNOW ALCOHOL DOES NOT DISCONNECT YOU.</li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Fortitude:</strong> 120 HP can absolutely make a difference.</li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Superior Defense:</strong> As a clothie the extra armor genuinely makes a big difference if you are ever meleed.</li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Greater Firepower:</strong> Releases the same phase as AQ, if unavailable use Elixir of Firepower.</li>  
			<li><strong>Brilliant Wizard Oil:</strong> Releases the same phase as AQ.</li>
			<li><strong>Major/Minor Troll's Blood.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Mageblood Potion:</strong> Not actually needed on this fight, since ~4k mana is enough.</li>
			<li><strong>Greater Arcane Elixir.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Shadow Power.</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>In terms of player buffs, you of course want Demon Armor: 15 SR, extra armor, and HP regen. All your standard raid buffs, except Salv. Ensure you have enough time on Prayer of Shadow Protection (60 SR), no less than 6 minutes - it doesn't hurt to have it refreshed before the fight.</p>
		<p>On Alliance, I highly recommend the Paladin in your group runs Devotion Aura. Their SR Aura doesn't stack with Prayer of Shadow Protection, and Concentration Aura is a negative in my opinion (see <a href="#pushback">Spell Pushback Analysis</a>). The FR Aura can be nice for the Explode Bug, but Devotion Aura could save your life in <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>. Melee Mode is a hectic situation, you want Devotion Aura already up so the Paladin can focus on healing.</p>
		<p>Frequently people ask about Crystalline Basilisk Spine. It gives an extra 10 SR but only for 1 minute, and it has a 2 minute CD. I really do NOT recommend this. Firstly, it makes your SR inconsistent. More importantly, it shares a CD with Healthstone. Healthstone is far more important since it is an emergency button if you get a Blizzard, Explode Bug, and Shadow Bolt combo.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="gearing">
    	<h2>5. Gearing</h2>
    	<p>With Demon Armor, Gift of Arthas, and Prayer of Shadow Protection, you have <strong>+85 SR from buffs</strong>.</p>
    	<p>Vek'lor's Shadow Bolt follows the non-binary spell resistance mechanism. This means you can partially resist 0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% of the damage, with higher partial resistance probabilities at higher SR. You cannot improve your chance to fully resist, it is fixed at a 1% chance.</p>
    	<figure id="fig16">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/resist-graph.jpg" alt="Graph of Partial Resist Probabilities.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 16: Partial resist probability vs SR (<em>credit: <a href="https://royalgiraffe.github.io/resist-calc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royalgiraffe</a></em>).</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a> shows the 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75%, partial resist probabilities as a function of SR. Notice that above 210 SR it becomes impossible to take a full damage Shadow Bolt. <strong>You must have over 210 SR to tank Twins safely</strong>, we will aim for much higher. 315 SR is the resistance cap versus bosses: Being above that value grants no additional benefits.</p>

    	<h3 id="gearing-stats">5.1 Stat Priority</h3>
    	<p><strong>Your highest priority stats are:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Shadow Resistance (SR)</li>
    		<li>Stamina (Stam)</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>A Warlock tank is of no use if they are dead. You want to optimize both SR and Stam to maximize your "Effective HP". Effective HP means the amount of raw (before resisting) damage that it would take to kill you on average. I recommend <a href="https://royalgiraffe.github.io/resist-calc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royalgiraffe's Calculator</a>, it's an invaluable tool for understanding what your SR is doing. To set it up you can use the following values:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Target Level = 60 (our level)</li>
    		<li>Attacker Level = 63 (boss level)</li>
    		<li>Attacker is NPC = TRUE</li>
    		<li>Binary Spell = FALSE (Shadow Bolt is non-binary)</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>You can then adjust the Resistance and Target Health values to match your in-raid stats. <a href="https://royalgiraffe.github.io/resist-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royalgiraffe's Resistance Guide</a> is superb, and it is my go to resource for any Vanilla WoW resistance questions I ever have.</p>
    	<p>Effective HP is not everything, just one useful metric. It is important to have high SR regardless of Effective HP to reduce the likelihood of back-to-back 75% Shadow Bolts. <strong>Ideally you can have 270+ SR, the higher the better.</strong></p>
    	<p>Regardless of SR, you must have a high level of Stamina - Blizzard and Explode Bug are not mitigated by our SR. We need a high enough pool of HP to survive them. Let's say you take a max damage Shadow Bolt (75% resisted), a max damage Blizzard tick, and a max damage Explode Bug, all without any heals and no protection potion active: That's ~8170 damage. Now that is <em>unlikely</em>: You should always be keeping track of your GFPP/GFrPP, and be recieving heals and Power Word:Shield. However, it is not impossible. For this reason, <strong>I recommend you have at least 8000 HP</strong>, irrespective of SR.</p>
    	<p><strong>Our secondary priority is Spell Hit.</strong> Consistent Searing Pain casts are important, specifically for the Teleport to overcome the Warrior's ~2100 initial Threat. However, I do think the requirement for Threat after this point is largely overblown - especially for Hardcore/progression. I've never had issues with staying above DPS, even with bad gear and bad RNG. Realistically it is the responsibility of the DPS to ensure they are watching their Threat meter. That said more Threat is never a bad thing, just don't overly sacrifice on SR/Stam.</p>
    	<p>Generally speaking, my rough rule of thumb is that I consider a Threat item good enough if provides at least 1% Spell Hit for every ~10 SR lost. I wouldn't want to lose more SR than that for 1% Hit. That said, you must take your full gear setup into account when weighing gear options.</p>
    	<p><strong>Lowest priority we have:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Spell Crit</li>
    		<li>Spell Power</li>
    		<li>Intellect</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>Crit and Spell Power are <em>okay</em>, but they are no where near as impactful as Spell Hit in terms of consistency. The question is, will these items meaningfully change the average number of Searing Pain casts to overcome the Warrior Threat, and the answer is typically no. Intellect is an essentially useless stat for this fight, you should naturally have over the ~4k mana required to tank a phase just incidentally from your other gear.</p>

    	<h3 id="gearing-example">5.2 Example SR Sets</h3>
    	<p>Let's say you have been farming MC/BWL/ZG and have zero AQ gear. Here is an example SR set you could wear for your first Twin Emps: <a href="https://sixtyupgrades.com/era/set/3SgdMQSZLQcjyiojmCsZYe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T2 + Crafted SR</a></p>
    	<figure id="fig17">

    		<figcaption>Fig 17: An example SR set using pre-AQ gear and crafted SR pieces.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a> shows the aforementioned example SR set. With world buffs, consumes, raid buffs, and Flask of Titans, this provides over 9100 HP, 276 SR, and 4% Spell Hit. These values do NOT include Blessing of Kings or other faction specific buffs.</p>
    	<p>I purposefully omitted Juno's Shadow and Eidolan Talisman, as these are rare/expensive BoE items. I also omitted the fantastic +10 SR leg/head enchants since these may not be available if you are not in Naxx content phase yet. Alternative items, and enchants, are detailed in the <a href="#gearing-items">Item Alternatives/Options</a> section.</p>
    	<p>For comparison, here is how an end-game SR set might look like with all content available: <a href="https://sixtyupgrades.com/era/set/24xqVozhj1vkXaQZN3Gi4J" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">End-Game SR</a></p>

    		<figcaption>Fig 18: An example SR set with access to content.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a> shows this example SR set. With world buffs, consumes, raid buffs, and Flask of Titans, this provides over 9200 HP, 296 SR, and 11% Spell Hit. Again, this is without Kings or faction specific buffs.</p>
    	<p>As Alliance I would be much more comfortable not running Flask of the Titans with these sets, after having beaten Twins  a few times of course. Without Blessing of Kings Horde has a tougher time, but you can lean more heavily into Stam pieces and less into Hit.</p>

    	<h3 id="gearing-items">5.3 Item Alternatives/Options</h3>
    	<p>I will now list some alternative options for each gear slot. I will not necessarily list every possible item in the game, especially for cases where it is not a SR set specific piece, for example I list the T2.5 helm but not T3 since it is functionally similar just slightly stronger. After listing gear items for each slot I also suggest enchanting recommendations (where applicable).</p>

		<p><strong>I do NOT recommend Spellweaver's Turban.</strong> Yes it has Spell Hit, but it has zero Stamina. If you have no raid gear, I would much prefer any high Stamina item, even if it is just an Uncommon BoE item.</p>
		<p><strong>For Head enchants we have a couple of options:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=22638/shadow-guard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shadow Guard:</a></strong> 10 SR, but sometimes pricey to get. Releases with Naxx content.</li>
			<li><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19788/hoodoo-hex" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hoodoo Hex:</a></strong> 10 Stam is decent, and if the item doubles as your main DPS Head this might be the way to go.</li>
			<li><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11642/lesser-arcanum-of-constitution" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Arcanum of Constitution:</a></strong> 100 HP is okay, and this is an alternative if the above are unavailable. You can also consider the +8 Stam <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=11646/lesser-arcanum-of-voracity" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lesser Arcanum of Voracity</a>, but the Librams are often expensive.</li>
