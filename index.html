        <h2>0. Preface</h2>
        <h3 id="preface-goal">0.1 The Goal of This Guide</h3>
        <p>The novelty of a Warlock tank has made Twin Emps highly discussed. However, in my experience, it is by far the most consistent and easy role in the fight. That said, it is incredibly fun!</p>
        <p>The primary goal of this guide is to coach anyone to be capable of performing the role in Hardcore, even if they have zero prior experience with AQ40 in any capacity. It provides a <a href="#stepbystep">step-by-step explanation</a> of how to perform the fight, as well as everything you need to know to prepare ahead of time.</p>
        <p>The nature of Hardcore demands consistent strategies that work on the first try. For that reason, the same strategies can be applied by non-Hardcore (softcore) guilds who are progressing the raid. It is not the task of this guide to discuss parse strategies, instead aiming for an extremely simple, repeatable, methodology with as little movement and intricacy as possible.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are several non-trivial questions on which I hope to share my knowledge. In particular the matters of <a href="#pushback">spell pushback mitigation</a>, and Vek'lor's <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>. The latter of which is still not fully understood.</p>
        <p>This is a very long document. Don't let it dissuade you from tanking Twins! Done right Warlock tanking on this fight should be very easy. I recommend you focus on the <a href="#stepbystep">Step-By-Step Tanking a Phase</a> and <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a> sections, then use the rest for further reading or as a reference to answer any questions you may have. I've included links to each section, and sub-section, in the <a href="#contents">Contents</a>, as well as a floating arrow in the bottom right that will take you back to the top.</p>

        <h3 id="preface-about">0.2 About the Author</h3>
        <p>Who is esuvii? In short, I love HC WoW and my favourite class is Warlock! I played Warlock through 2019 Classic, TBC and WotLK. In mid-late 2020, I first tried Hardcore, largely inspired by watching B0aty play HCIM OSRS I attempted (and succeeded) to level a HC Hunter to 60. Later I began to actively play as a member of the Classic Hardcore community, and in November 2021 I joined the HC Road to Ragnaros event in Season of Mastery. Ever since then I've been raiding as a Warlock in HC Elite.</p>
        <p>As of writing this, I've played Warlock on Twins Emps a minimum of:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>32 times in softcore.</li>
        	<li>12 times in unofficial HC on BSB (including the first ever clear).</li>
        	<li>73 times in official HC on Defias Pillager (including the world first official clear).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During this time I have coached several Warlocks to tank Twins in HC, including those with zero experience.</p>
        <p><strong>We have NEVER had a Warlock tank die on Twins.</strong></p>
        <p>Through HC I have tanked in a BWL level SR set, absolute BiS SR gear, fresh 60 + crafted SR gear, and one time when I forgot to equip SR gear.</p>
        <p><em>While there is no single highest authority on this fight, I believe there is a strong case that I have the most HC experience.</em></p>

    <section id="basics">
    	<h2>1. The Basics</h2>
    	<p>Twin Emperors, as the name suggests, is a fight with two bosses: Vek'lor (caster boss), and Vek'nilash (melee boss). It is a required boss, situated after Huhuran, and opens the door which leads to Ouro and C'thun.</p>
    	<figure id="fig1">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/boss-room.jpg" alt="The boss room, Vek'lor back-left, Vek'nilash back-right.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 1: The Twin Emps boss room.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Here we see the boss starting positions, <a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>. You will either be the "left side" or "right side" Warlock tank, and will stay within those areas. We'll see this in much more detail in the <a href="#positioning">Positioning</a> section.</p>
    	<p>The fight typically lasts between 3 to 5 minutes. It is not a DPS race, the enrage (Berserk) timer is 15 minutes - you must kill the bosses in this time, but that should not be an issue. Vek'lor and Vek'nilash share a percentage health pool, damage to one will hurt the other, so it is okay if your raid is heavily skewed towards magical or physical damage.</p>
    	<p>The final shared mechanic is Heal Brother. If the bosses are within 60 yds they will spam heal each other for 300k per cast. This is why we tank them on opposite sides of the room.</p>

    	<h3 id="basics-teleport">1.1 Twin Teleport</h3>
    	<p>The most fundamental mechanic of this fight is the Twin Teleport. Perodically the bosses will Teleport, swapping positions. All Threat is reset, and whoever is closest to a boss will gain 2000 Threat for that boss. While you are waiting (AFK Phase), i.e. Vek'nilash is on your side, you must ensure you are ready to begin tanking Vek'lor immediately after the Teleport.</p>
    	<figure id="fig2">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/DBM-teleport.jpg" alt="Example DBM timer for Twin Teleport.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 2: An example DBM timer for the Twin Teleport.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>The Teleport timing is random, and <em>will</em> happen any time during a ~11 second window, starting ~29s after the previous Teleport. DBM's data suggests the earliest Teleport (window open) is after ~29.2s and the latest is ~40.2s (window closes). <a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>, shows how my DBM timer looks for the Twin Teleport. The transparent part of the timer represents the time until the Teleport window opens, and the highlighted portion on the right side is the maximum possible duration of the window.</p>
    	<figure id="fig3">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/DBM-settings.jpg" alt="My DBM timer settings.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 3: My DBM timer settings.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Depending on how your DBM is configured, or if you are using a different addon such as BigWigs, your timer may look different. In <a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a> you can see how I configured my timer to countdown until the window opens, instead of the default of until it would close. This is down to personal preference, and the way addons look is likely to change in the future.</p>
    	<p>When they Teleport it is imperative that all DPS are away from the bosses, and have no large DoTs (e.g. Ignite) rolling. This can result in the bosses moving, and possibly killing people.</p>

    	<h3 id="basics-veklor">1.2 Vek'lor</h3>
    	<p>Emperor Vek'lor is the caster boss; he is immune to all physical damage. This is the boss we Warlock tank. While it is <em>technically</em> possible for other classes to tank him (e.g. a Paladin spamming GBoK), we will not cover that - Warlock is by far the safest choice.</p>

    	<p>Emperor Vek'nilash is the melee boss; he is immune to all magic damage (except Holy). For completeness I will list his abilities, however it is the Warrior tank on your side's job to tank him. We should never have to interact with Vek'nilash.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
		</div>

    	<h3 id="basics-roles">1.4 Roles</h3>
    	<p>For the strategy presented here we require:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>2 Warrior tanks, one for each side to tank Vek'nilash.</li>
    		<li>2 Warlock tanks, one for each side to tank Vek'lor.</li>
    		<li>Someone to pull Vek'nilash at the start of the fight, ideally a Hunter.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>You will also have healers split between the left/right sides.</p>
    	<p>While it is possible to tank Twins with a single Warlock, situated in the middle of the room and swapping sides, I will not cover it here. That setup is not recommended, since our goal is a consistent and safe strategy.</p>
    	<p><em>Note that throughout this guide I refer to "Warrior tanks" to distinguish them from the Warlock tank, however it is possible for a geared Feral Druid to tank Vek'nilash instead of a Warrior.</em></p>
    	<p>Warlock is the canonical choice for tanking Vek'lor: Each point of Searing Pain damage generates two Threat (2x modifier), Demon Armor provides extra SR, we have Shadow Ward for extra mitigation, and our Talents allow even more survivability/Threat.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="stepbystep">
    	<h2>2. Step-By-Step Tanking a Phase</h2>
    	<p>In this section we will cover your rotation, and how to handle a tanking phase. For where to stand, with annotated images, and example videos of tanking left/right side, please see the <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a> section.</p>
    	<p>Before the fight begins please double check:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Your SR set is equipped.</li>
    		<li>You have Prayer of Shadow Protection, with at least 6 minutes left.</li>
    		<li>You have Gift of Arthas, GAPP, GFrPP, and GFFP. We will discuss these consumables in more detail in the <a href="#consumables">Consumable List</a> section.</li>
    		<li>Blessing of Salvation is removed (Alliance only).</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>To remove Salv I use the following macro:</p>
    	<div class="code-block"><pre><code>/cancelaura Blessing of Salvation
/cancelaura Greater Blessing of Salvation</code></pre></div>
    	<p>Some people like to include this in one of their ability macros, however personally I just have it on my bars and manually click it a few times before the pull.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-preteleport">2.1 Pre-Teleport</h3>
    	<p>Let's start from before Vek'lor teleports to you. The Warrior on your side is tanking Vek'nilash and you are waiting for the Teleport. There is no need to rush, you have around 20-30s to prepare before the next phase:</p>
    	<ol>
    		<li>Life Tap back to full mana. It takes approximately 4000 mana to tank each phase, so you should <strong>NEVER Life Tap while tanking Vek'lor</strong>. You can do this now, during your AFK phase.</li>
    		<li>Stand in the correct place (see <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a>), you may have to adjust a little.</li>
    		<li>Before the window opens cast Shadow Ward. This will help with mitigation for the first Shadow Bolt you recieve after taking aggro of Vek'lor.</li>
    		<li>Ensure you have <strong>Vek'lor</strong> targeted. Remember, this boss is currently on the opposite side.</li>
    		<li>Before the Teleport window opens start spamming Searing Pain. This ensures you begin your cast as soon as possible after Teleport.</li>
    	</ol> 
    	<h3 id="stepbystep-teleport">2.2 Teleport</h3>
    	<p>Vek'lor has teleported and you should have immediately started casting Searing Pain. Assuming DPS all left before the Teleport, the Warrior will have ~2.1k Threat on Vek'lor - this is the initial Threat that the closest player gets (modified by Defensive Stance). The boss be inactive for ~1.5s, during this the Warrior should immediately run out to a similar distance as you.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Keep casting Searing Pain.</li>
    		<li>Vek'lor should not move, and will begin casting Shadow Bolts on the Warrior tank. This is normal. It is okay for the Warrior to take 2-3 Shadow Bolts before you are top Threat - your healers will be prepared for this.</li>
    		<li>After 3-4 casts you should overtake the Warrior and be the top Threat.</li>
    		<li>Keep casting Searing Pain.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>If Vek'lor starts running at you, or the Warrior, or casts Arcane Burst, he may be in Melee Mode. If everyone is follows the strategy this is extremely rare, however please see the <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>section for some suggestions about how to handle it.</p>
    	<figure id="fig4">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/resist-wa.webp" alt="My Searing Pain Resist WA.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 4: My Searing Pain resist WeakAura.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>I use a WeakAura that I wrote to announce in /yell if my Searing Pain resists when casting on Vek'lor. <a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a> shows how it looks. It is not required, but it is useful for indicating to the healers that you are having a tough time overcoming the initial Threat of the Warrior tank. You can import it here: <a href="https://wago.io/Qvo4g9stE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vek'lor Searing Pain Resist</a></p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-explode">2.3 Explode Bug</h3>
    	<p>Vek'lor will periodically cast Explode Bug. A fire animation will appear on the exploding bug, before it grows in size and then explodes. <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a> shows this fire animation.</p>
    	<figure id="fig5">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/bug-on-fire.jpg" alt="A Scorpion about to explode.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 5: A Scorpion targeted by Explode Bug.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>At this point you have a few options, and must make a judgement call:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>Tank the Explosion:</strong> If the bug is too close, or you can't avoid it due to the wall or Blizzard, you can ignore it and take the damage. If your GFPP is fully active you should absorb most of it.</li>
    		<li><strong>Move:</strong> If the bug is not right on top of you then you may be able to move to avoid it.</li>
    		<li><strong>Death Coil:</strong> RNG option to make the bug move away from you. This requires quick reactions, and swapping targets, so I do not advise it for your first time tanking Twins.</li>
    	</ul>

    	<p>If you are moving away from the bug, it is important you follow an arc that keeps your distance to Vek'lor fixed. If you move out of his range he will chase you triggering Melee Mode. If you move too close he may enter Melee Mode and Arcane Burst you. <a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a> shows the circular path around Vek'lor that you should restrict your movement to. If you are in range, while moving you could Shadowburn to compensate for the lost casts. However, this is likely unnecessary unless someone is close on Threat.</p>
    	<p>If you take the explosion damage, and your health drops low you can use your Healthstone. This is particularly useful if you are facing multiple mechanics at once, for example Blizzard and Explode Bug and a Shadow Bolt from Vek'lor. Keep in mind that your GFPP is now gone. You can either pop a new GFPP or save your potion CD. If you choose to save your potion CD, be ready to drink a GFPP if another Explode Bug is nearby - before you take damage from it.</p>

		    <figcaption>Video 1: Using Death Coil to avoid Explode Bug.</figcaption>
		</figure>
    	<p>Using Death Coil is a more advanced play. It has to be a quick reaction, and it is inconsistent due to the random direction the bug will move. However, it can be a useful tool if you cannot move, and pulling it off will make those who see it consider you a pro-gamer. <a href="#vid1">Video 1</a> shows me performing the Death Coil.</p>
    	<p>A good healer will notice you are about to take Explode Bug or Blizzard damage and start a big heal or Power Word: Shield you. A call of <em>"big heals on me"</em> or a healer saying <em>"big heals on your-name"</em> is great to ensure everyone knows the damage is coming.</p>
  		<p>The Warrior tank is AFK for most of this phase. If they are experienced with the fight they will kill the Scarabs/Scorpions around you, so that none are near enough to explode on you. Be aware that they do respawn.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-blizzard">2.4 Blizzard</h3>
    	<p>Unlike Explode Bug, <strong>you should NOT stay still and tank the Blizzard</strong>. It ticks for ~1500 Frost damage. Your GFrPP will mitigate the first, and <em>maybe</em> the second, tick. You should move as discussed before, see <a href="#fig5">Figure 6</a>, to ensure you are a consistent distance from Vek'lor.</p>
    	<p>It is not impossible to tank the Blizzard, but know you will be taking ~8000 damage over 10s (5 ticks). If you absolutely must stay in it, wait for your active GFrPP to be used up then pop another one. You will need really big heals during this time, and I really do not recommend it unless there is no other option. Remember you have Healthstone if you are taking a lot of damage.</p>
    	<p><strong>Blizzard always spawns on a player.</strong> This is why in <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a> we will see that we are away from the DPS stack. This greatly reduces the chance it spawns on us. However, you may catch the edge of a Blizzard that has spawned on the Warrior tank or a healer.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>In <a href="#vid2">Video 2</a> you see an example of me moving out of Blizzard. We get the worst RNG here and an Explode Bug happens right where I move towards. I choose to tank the explosion since I consider avoiding the Blizzard a higher priority.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-doom">2.5 Curse of Doom</h3>
    	<p>A bonus tool to help with initial Threat is Curse of Doom. Due to the variation of Teleport timings, it is not going to work consistently. The idea is to cast Doom while tanking Vek'lor, and it will pop during your <em>next</em> tanking phase.</p>
    	<figure id="fig7">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/doom.jpg" alt="Curse of Doom applied.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 7: An example Curse of Doom.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>The timing is not perfect, and it will take trial and error. <strong>I have found that casting around 20s before the Teleport window opens (~10s after the boss appears) works well</strong>, see <a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>.</p>
    	<p><strong>If you cast a little early</strong>, it will simply pop near the end of the other Warlock's tanking phase. That Warlock should have a lot of Threat, so there is no risk.</p>
    	<p><strong>If you cast a little late</strong> it will still pop on your side, but it will be later into the tanking phase. This still boosts your Threat, but you likely already have a comfortable lead at that point.</p>
    	<p>If my 20s timing isn't working, I recommend trying ~17/18s before the Teleport window opens. You can then gradually be greedier (earlier) as you get a feel for it.</p>
    	<p>If Curse of Doom resists, or it is your final tanking phase, you can cast Curse of the Elements. This marginally helps both you and the opposite side Warlock overcome the 2k initial Threat. However, it will not always change the number of Searing Pain casts required to overtake the Warrior. You can also just use Elements if you don't want to have to think about Curse of Doom - just make sure you have a Threat lead before initially applying it.</p>
    	<p>If you have a 3rd Warlock (a non-tank), you likely already have Elements up. In that case, the backup would be Curse of Shadow. Often Mages will swap to Arcane Missiles to ensure Ignite falls before the Twin Teleport. It is minor, but it does increase that damage.</p>

    	<h3 id="stepbystep-ending">2.6 Ending a Phase</h3>
    	<p>If you keep casting Searing Pain right up until the boss Teleports away, there is a very small chance that your final cast will land during the same 10ms spell batching window as the Teleport. If this happens, you could be top threat on Vek'lor after he appears on the opposite side. This is rare, but I have seen it a couple of times.</p>
    	<p>Once the Teleport window opens, DPS will stop (they swap sides) and you no longer need to build Threat. For safety I stop casting Searing Pain after the Teleport window opens. You can just wait for the Teleport, still avoiding mechanics of course. Keep an eye on the Threat meter to ensure there aren't any DoTs that might cause a DPS to overtake you - although this has never been an issue for me.</p>

    		<figcaption>Fig 8: The Vek'nilash tank closer to Vek'lor before Teleport.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>It is crucial that the Warrior tank is closer to the boss than you when the Teleport window opens. Otherwise you will get the initial Threat from Vek'nilash. In <a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a> you can see the Vek'nilash tank has moved closer than me in preparation for Teleport. It's important to pay attention to this, so you can reposition to compensate if necessary.</p>
    	<p><strong>Congratulations! You just tanked a phase! Now loop back to the start of these steps and await the next tanking phase!</strong></p>

    <section id="positioning">
    	<h2>3. Movement and Positioning</h2>
    	<p>In this section I'll show the positioning for the left/right sides, along with an explanation of the pull. This is where our strategy deviates from most common Twin Emps strategies. In many guides you are shown a Warlock kiting Vek'lor on the pull. We will not do this. Instead all boss movement is done by the Warrior tank. This eliminates two huge issues:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Kiting a caster mob to a precise location is very inconsistent.</li>
    		<li>Kiting Vek'lor requires outranging him, which in many cases forces him to enter Melee Mode.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>As you will see we require zero boss positioning from the Warlock tank, resulting in a simple and easily reproducible strategy.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-pull">3.1 The Pull</h3>
    	<p>As discussed in the <a href="#stepbystep">previous section</a>, it is crucial that you double check you have your SR set equipped, consumables popped, and Blessing of Salvation removed before the pull begins. It is the Left Warlock tank that will be pulling Vek'lor, the Right Warlock tank can be in their final tanking position before the fight begins and wait there for their tanking phase.</p>
    	<figure id="fig9">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/pull-raidplan.jpg" alt="Pre-pull positioning.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 9: The pre-pull positioning.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>In <a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a> you see the pre-pull positioning. As the Left side Warlock you want to start out of Searing Pain range just before the corner of Vek'lor's staircase. I recommend at least a 10s pull timer, so that you can pull Vek'lor at the same time as the Hunter pulls Vek'linash.</p>
    	<figure id="fig10">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/staircase.jpg" alt="The corner of the staircase, ready to pull.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 10: Just in range of Searing Pain.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Once the pull timer begins:</p>
    	<ol>
    		<li>Cast Shadow Ward</li>
    		<li>Target Vek'lor</li>
    		<li>Step onto the corner of the staircase, and with ~4-5s remaining tap forwards until you see your Searing Pain icon show that it is in range. <a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a> shows me on the corner of the staircase, barely in range to Searing Pain.</li>
    		<li>When the timer is at ~1s begin casting Searing Pain.</li>
    		<li>Do not kite Vek'lor, stay in position and tank this like a normal tanking phase.</li>
    	</ol>
    	<p>Over on the right side the Hunter will be timing their pull to hit Vek'nilash at approximately zero on the pull timer, the same as you. A typical pull for the Hunter might be Aimed Shot, Auto Shot, Multi-Shot; enough to hold Threat off of the healers until the Warrior tank picks up Vek'nilash. Once the Hunter has fired their combo they will immediately run backwards towards the Right Warlock, and the right side Warrior tank will run in and pickup the boss. The right side Warrior can then bring Vek'linash to the right side's final tanking position, the torch on the wall being a useful indicator.</p>
    	<p>Now the pull has begun, and Threat established, DPS will begin to attack and the Warrior tank on the left side will move closer than you to ensure the initial Threat after the first Teleport.</p>
    	<figure id="fig11">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/first-teleport.jpg" alt="The first Teleport.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 11: Positioning immediately after the first Teleport.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>, shows how the positioning will look immediately after the first Teleport:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>The Warrior tank on the left side has initial Threat on Vek'nilash and is about to bring him to the final tanking position, over by the torch.</li>
    		<li>The Left Warlock is moving back into their final tanking position.</li>
    		<li>The Right Warlock has begun their first tanking phase.</li>
    		<li>The Warrior tank on the right side is moving out of Vek'lor's melee range, immediately after the Teleport.</li>
    		<li>The Caster DPS and Melee DPS are swapping sides.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>At this point the pull phase is complete, and we are into the main stage of the fight. <strong>Notice that boss repositioning was always done by the Warrior tanking Vek'nilash, never Vek'lor.</strong> If Vek'lor gets out of position, generally you can adjust to the new position and wait for the Warrior tank to reposition during their next tanking phase.</p>
    	<p>In <a href="#vid3">Video 3</a> the Left Warlock's PoV is shown, and included in this is a demonstration of the pull.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-left">3.2 Left Side</h3>
    	<p>In <a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a> we see the typical positioning of left side during their normal tanking phase (not the pull).</p>
    	<figure id="fig12">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/left-side.jpg" alt="Left side positioning.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 12: The left side positioning.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>If you are running SM/Ruin, or another spec that provides Blood Pact, you will start with your Imp on follow for the pull. After the first Teleport, while you are moving into position you can set your Imp to stay roughly mid-way between the torch (boss position) and your tanking position. This ensures both you and the Warrior tank have Blood Pact. <strong>It is crucial that your Imp stays Passive and Phase Shifted</strong>, i.e. beware your any pet attack macros.</p>

    		<figcaption>Fig 13: 1 small + 1 large tile from the boss.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>A common question is "How far should I be from Vek'lor?". The floor at the sides of the rooms is divided into alternating large plus shaped tiles, and smaller square tiles. My rule of thumb is, <strong>1 large + 1 small tile from the boss</strong>, as shown in <a href="#fig13">Figure 13.</a> You can be a touch further than this if you wish, but try not to be closer.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-right">3.3 Right Side</h3>
    	<p>The Right Warlock's positioning is a mirror image of the left side, except of course you do not do the pull. You can be in your final tanking position before the fight even begins.</p>

    	<h3 id="positioning-warrior">3.4 Warrior Movement</h3>
    	<p>The Warrior tank's movement is crucial on this fight. You have a good perspective on their positioning, better than they do, if something can be improved <em>gently</em> let them know - remember a Warrior's resource is Rage!</p>
    	<p><strong>Vek'nilash Teleports away:</strong> Immediately after Vek'nilash Teleports away and Vek'lor appears the Warrior must run out of melee and Arcane Burst range. Vek'lor does nothing for the first 1-2s after Teleport, this is the window they have to move. They can run to the Warlock tank as a guide. Failure to get far enough away quick enough can cause the boss to enter <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>.</p>
    	<p><strong>Teleport window opens:</strong> Before the Teleport window opens the Warrior tank must be the closest player to the boss, to get the initial Threat. That does not mean in melee range of Vek'lor. As before Vek'nilash will be inactive for the first 1-2s during which time they can run in and connect.</p>
    	<figure id="fig15">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/perpendicular.jpg" alt="A Warrior with back to the wall.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 15: A Warrior tanking with their back perfectly to the wall.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><strong>Uppercut knockback:</strong> If the Warrior tank is Uppercut right in the Teleport window then it can cause Vek'nilash to move out of position just before the Teleport happens. Even if their back is to the wall, tanking at an angle can cause them to be knocked along the wall. If a drawn line through Vek'nilash and the Warrior tank is perpendicular to the wall, then the Warrior will be knocked directly back into it and not be moved, see <a href="#fig15">Figure 15</a>. This positioning is optimal.</p>
    	<p><strong>Explode Bug:</strong> While the Warlock is tanking, but prior to the Teleport window opening, the Warrior tank can kill the Scarabs/Scorpions nearby the Warlock. This greatly reduces chance of taking explosion damage.</p>

		</div>
		<p>As stated previously, you want Gift of Arthas, GFPP, GFrPP, and GAPP all active before the fight. I do not use GSPP, since our SR gear will mitigate the Shadow Bolts. There is no harm in having a GSPP up prior to the fight, but I would never waste my potion CD on it during the fight. We Shadow Ward before a tanking phase to soften the first hit and allow healers a chance to swap targets.</p>
		<p>Additionally you want to use your standard raid consumables:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Spirit of Zanza:</strong> Lung Juice Cocktail if you don't have the rep.</li>
			<li><strong>Flask of the Titans:</strong> I recommend this for progression, or your first try on a character. After that you can judge based on how low you are getting.</li>
			<li><strong>Stamina Food:</strong> A 12 stam food, or Chimaerok Chops (25 stam) if you have access to them.</li>
			<li><strong>Rumsey Rum Black Label:</strong> ONLY IF YOU KNOW ALCOHOL DOES NOT DISCONNECT YOU.</li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Fortitude:</strong> 120 HP can absolutely make a difference.</li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Superior Defense:</strong> As a clothie the extra armor genuinely makes a big difference if you are ever meleed.</li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Greater Firepower:</strong> Releases the same phase as AQ, if unavailable use Elixir of Firepower.</li>  
			<li><strong>Brilliant Wizard Oil:</strong> Releases the same phase as AQ.</li>
			<li><strong>Major/Minor Troll's Blood.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Mageblood Potion:</strong> Not actually needed on this fight, since ~4k mana is enough.</li>
			<li><strong>Greater Arcane Elixir.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Elixir of Shadow Power.</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p>Remember if you are on a server with a buff cap (e.g. old Classic Era servers), be mindful of which consumables you are using. This is not a concern in HC, or on Anniversary servers, where there is no buff cap.</p>
		<p>In terms of player buffs, you of course want Demon Armor: 15 SR, extra armor, and HP regen. All your standard raid buffs, except Salv. Ensure you have enough time on Prayer of Shadow Protection (60 SR), no less than 6 minutes - it doesn't hurt to have it refreshed before the fight.</p>
		<p>On Alliance, I highly recommend the Paladin in your group runs Devotion Aura. Their SR Aura doesn't stack with Prayer of Shadow Protection, and Concentration Aura is a negative in my opinion (see <a href="#pushback">Spell Pushback Analysis</a>). The FR Aura can be nice for the Explode Bug, but Devotion Aura could save your life in <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>. Melee Mode is a hectic situation, you want Devotion Aura already up so the Paladin can focus on healing.</p>
		<p>Frequently people ask about Crystalline Basilisk Spine. It gives an extra 10 SR but only for 1 minute, and it has a 2 minute CD. I really do NOT recommend this. Firstly, it makes your SR inconsistent. More importantly, it shares a CD with Healthstone. Healthstone is far more important since it is an emergency button if you get a Blizzard, Explode Bug, and Shadow Bolt combo.</p>
		<p>For my first ever time tanking Twins in HC I used both Juju Chill and Juju Ember, to try to mitigate the Explode Bug and Blizzard damage. To be honest, this felt like it had a negligible impact. However, if you have time to burn and want to overprepare it cannot hurt to use them.</p>

    <section id="gearing">
    	<h2>5. Gearing</h2>
    	<p>With Demon Armor, Gift of Arthas, and Prayer of Shadow Protection, you have <strong>+85 SR from buffs</strong>.</p>
    	<p>Vek'lor's Shadow Bolt follows the non-binary spell resistance mechanism. This means you can partially resist 0%, 25%, 50%, or 75% of the damage, with higher partial resistance probabilities at higher SR. You cannot improve your chance to fully resist, it is fixed at a 1% chance.</p>
    	<figure id="fig16">

    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig16">Figure 16</a> shows the 0%, 25%, 50%, and 75%, partial resist probabilities as a function of SR. Notice that above 210 SR it becomes impossible to take a full damage Shadow Bolt. <strong>You must have over 210 SR to tank Twins safely</strong>, we will aim for much higher. 315 SR is the resistance cap versus bosses: Being above that value grants no additional benefits.</p>

    	<h3 id="gearing-stats">5.1 Stat Priority</h3>
    	<p><strong>Your highest priority stats are:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Shadow Resistance (SR)</li>
    		<li>Stamina (Stam)</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>A Warlock tank is of no use if they are dead. You want to optimize both SR and Stam to maximize your "Effective HP". Effective HP means the amount of raw (before resisting) damage that it would take to kill you on average. I recommend <a href="https://royalgiraffe.github.io/resist-calc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royalgiraffe's Calculator</a>, it's an invaluable tool for understanding what your SR is doing. To set it up you can use the following values:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Target Level = 60 (our level)</li>
    		<li>Attacker Level = 63 (boss level)</li>
    		<li>Attacker is NPC = TRUE</li>
    		<li>Binary Spell = FALSE (Shadow Bolt is non-binary)</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>You can then adjust the Resistance and Target Health values to match your in-raid stats. <a href="https://royalgiraffe.github.io/resist-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Royalgiraffe's Resistance Guide</a> is superb, and it is my go to resource for any Vanilla WoW resistance questions I ever have.</p>
    	<p>Effective HP is not everything, just one useful metric. It is important to have high SR regardless of Effective HP to reduce the likelihood of back-to-back 75% Shadow Bolts. <strong>Ideally you can have 270+ SR, the higher the better.</strong></p>
    	<p>Regardless of SR, you must have a high level of Stamina - Blizzard and Explode Bug are not mitigated by our SR. We need a high enough pool of HP to survive them. Let's say you take a max damage Shadow Bolt (75% resisted), a max damage Blizzard tick, and a max damage Explode Bug, all without any heals and no protection potion active: That's ~8170 damage. Now that is <em>unlikely</em>: You should always be keeping track of your GFPP/GFrPP, and be recieving heals and Power Word:Shield. However, it is not impossible. For this reason, <strong>I recommend you have at least 8000 HP</strong>, irrespective of SR.</p>
    	<p><strong>Our secondary priority is Spell Hit.</strong> Consistent Searing Pain casts are important, specifically for the Teleport to overcome the Warrior's ~2100 initial Threat. However, I do think the requirement for Threat after this point is largely overblown - especially for Hardcore/progression. I've never had issues with staying above DPS, even with bad gear and bad RNG. Realistically it is the responsibility of the DPS to ensure they are watching their Threat meter. That said more Threat is never a bad thing, just don't overly sacrifice on SR/Stam.</p>
    	<p>Generally speaking, my rough rule of thumb is that I consider a Threat item good enough if provides at least 1% Spell Hit for every ~10 SR lost. I wouldn't want to lose more SR than that for 1% Hit. That said, you must take your full gear setup into account when weighing gear options.</p>
    	<p><strong>Lowest priority we have:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Spell Crit</li>
    		<li>Spell Power</li>
    		<li>Intellect</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>Crit and Spell Power are <em>okay</em>, but they are no where near as impactful as Spell Hit in terms of consistency. The question is, will these items meaningfully change the average number of Searing Pain casts to overcome the Warrior Threat, and the answer is typically no. Intellect is an essentially useless stat for this fight, you should naturally have over the ~4k mana required to tank a phase just incidentally from your other gear.</p>

    	<h3 id="gearing-example">5.2 Example SR Sets</h3>
    	<p>Let's say you have been farming MC/BWL/ZG and have zero AQ gear. Here is an example SR set you could wear for your first Twin Emps: <a href="https://sixtyupgrades.com/era/set/3SgdMQSZLQcjyiojmCsZYe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">T2 + Crafted SR</a></p>
    	<figure id="fig17">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/t2-sr-set.jpg" alt="T2 + Crafted SR Set.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 17: An example SR set using pre-AQ gear and crafted SR pieces.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig17">Figure 17</a> shows the aforementioned example SR set. With world buffs, consumes, raid buffs, and Flask of Titans, this provides over 9000 HP, 284 SR, and 4% Spell Hit. These values do NOT include Blessing of Kings or other faction specific buffs. I have assumed we have the +42 Stam from Blood Pact, which contributes ~500 HP.</p>
    	<p>I purposefully omitted Juno's Shadow and Eidolan Talisman, as these are rare/expensive BoE items. I also omitted the fantastic +10 SR leg/head enchants since these may not be available if you are not in Naxx content phase yet. Alternative items, and enchants, are detailed in the <a href="#gearing-items">Item Alternatives/Options</a> section. Note that Sixty Upgrades does not understand the Deathmist 2-set bonus.</p>
    	<p>For comparison, here is how an end-game SR set might look like with all content available: <a href="https://sixtyupgrades.com/era/set/24xqVozhj1vkXaQZN3Gi4J" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">End-Game SR</a></p>
    	<figure id="fig18">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/bis-sr-set.jpg" alt="End-Game SR Set.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 18: An example SR set with access to all content.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig18">Figure 18</a> shows this example SR set. With world buffs, consumes, raid buffs, and Flask of Titans, this provides over 9200 HP, 296 SR, and 11% Spell Hit. Again, this is without Kings or faction specific buffs.</p>
    	<p>As Alliance I would be much more comfortable not running Flask of the Titans with these sets, after having beaten Twins  a few times of course. Without Blessing of Kings Horde has a tougher time, but you can lean more heavily into Stam pieces and less into Hit.</p>

    	<h3 id="gearing-items">5.3 Item Alternatives/Options</h3>
    	<p>I will now list some alternative options for each gear slot. I will not necessarily list every possible item in the game, especially for cases where it is not a SR set specific piece, for example I list the T2.5 helm but not T3 since it is functionally similar just slightly stronger. After listing gear items for each slot I also suggest enchanting recommendations (where applicable).</p>

		<p>If you don't have T1 shoulders, there are many options that have high stamina. I would fallback on those if you don't have T1.</p>

At Exalted there is also the Chromatic version for +5 to all resistances.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>However, +5 SR is not a ton. If these are your main DPS shoulders and you have the Zandalar Signet of Mojo, or Power of the Scourge, on them that is generally fine. If it's just for Twins though I would recommend the AD enchant. There is also Fortitude of the Scourge from Sapph, with +16 Stam, but good luck getting that - if you have it you probably didn't need this guide!</p>

		<p>The T0.5 are quite easy to make. However, if you cannot get any of the above I would wear whatever has the most Stam. Some people like <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=19929/bloodtinged-gloves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloodtinged Gloves</a> from ZG, but with 6 Stam less than T0.5 (and no set bonus) I would avoid them.

			        High level BoE Rings can have up to +22 SR (depending on ilvl and RNG). While not farmable, the AH or your guild bank may have some. These are an excellent way to gain a lot of SR without losing too much Stam. I would try to look for at least +17 SR, ideally 19+. <strong>Personally I run two of these.</strong></p>

			<p>In my guild people mail high SR BoE Rings they find to my bank alt and I later distribute them to new Warlock tanks. I suspect a similar thing happens in most guilds. Getting ~40 SR from your Ring slots is a great start to your SR set, and I really recommend this approach. If you cannot find them from guild/AH then I suggest using your highest Stam, or Spell Hit, Rings.</p>

		<p>Generally speaking, you should be using two Ultra-Flash Shadow Reflectors (or one paired with Nelth's Tear). If you cannot wear any of the above just wear your standard DPS trinkets.

			       Generally speaking, <strong>I do NOT recommend this</strong>. However, if you are stuck with only a Main Hand Weapon, and no good Off Hand, then it is quite easy to farm. Note that it is possible to get up to +15 SR "of Shadow Resistance" Off Hands, although they are extremely rare.</p>
			    </div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>As mentioned before, you are typically just going to use whatever Weapon you have available for Twins. Two-Hand Weapons typically have much more Stamina, but you can use a Main Hand + Off Hand just fine. I would choose whichever setup you have access to that provides Spell Hit without compromising on Stam. It's worthwhile holding onto an old Weapon if it provides more Stam and/or Hit than your current DPS setup. If your setup is lacking HP, a Two-Hand Weapon can be a great way to improve that. If you have lots of Stam and SR, then you can lean more heavily into the Spell Hit.</p>
		<p><strong>There really is only one impactful Weapon enchant:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=22749/enchant-weapon-spell-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spell Power:</a></strong> +30 SP. This isn't nothing, but Spell Power is far from the most important stat on Twins. If this is an SR set specific Weapon, and you are strapped for gold, you can skip this Enchant. With limited gold your priority should be the Runed Stygian items and Shadow Reflectors.</li>

			       If you can't get Serpentine Skuller, and you vendored Gravestone Scepter while leveling, this is an option for a little Stam. I believe this only drops once the AQ phase begins on your realm.</p>
			    </div>
			</div>
		</div>
		<p>If you cannot get the Serpentine Skuller, there are a few Wands out there with Stam on them, including BoE "of the Eagle" Wands - although these are typically expensive on the AH. Don't overfocus on Serpentine Skuller: If you're having a tough time getting it to drop work on the rest of your SR set then revisit it later.</p>

		<h3 id=gearing-runed-stygian>5.4 Runed Stygian Patterns</h3>
		<p>If you cannot find a Tailor that knows the Runed Stygian crafts, you may need to help your guild farm them. This can be extremely time consuming, and potentially expensive. However, as discussed previously, these items are well worth the trouble.</p>
		<p>The patterns are obtained by tuning in lots of 10 <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20404/encrypted-twilight-text" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Encrypted Twilight Texts</a> to <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15194/hermit-ortell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hermit Ortell</a> in Silithus. He's in a small cave in the South East corner of the zone, just East of Hive'Regal. <strong>This is NOT the same as turning Twilight Texts in at Cenarion Hold.</strong> The quest you are looking for is the initial <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8323/true-believers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">True Believers</a>,  and it's followup repeatable counterpart <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/quest=8324/still-believing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Still Believing</a>.</p>
		<p>This turn in has no immediately obvious item reward, and no reputation reward. However, after several hours Ortell will mail you <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20469/decoded-true-believer-clippings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decoded True Believer Clippings</a>. This can contain various scrolls and recipes, but most importantly there is a small chance for it to contain one of the three Runed Stygian patterns:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20548/pattern-runed-stygian-belt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pattern: Runed Stygian Belt</a>: 6x Dark Rune, 2x Felcloth, 2x Bolt of Runecloth, 2x Ironweb Spider Silk, 2x Enchanted Leather.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20546/pattern-runed-stygian-leggings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pattern: Runed Stygian Leggings</a>: 8x Dark Rune, 6x Felcloth, 6x Bolt of Runecloth, 2x Ironweb Spider Silk.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=20547/pattern-runed-stygian-boots" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pattern: Runed Stygian Boots</a>: 6x Dark Rune, 4x Felcloth, 4x Bolt of Runecloth, 2x Ironweb Spider Silk, 2x Enchanted Leather.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>I believe each of these patterns has a ~4% chance of appearing in the mail. This means that if you are looking for a specific pattern it will take on average 25 turn-ins (250 Texts) to find that specific item. To attain at least one of every pattern would require on average ~46 turn-ins, however while searching for the final pattern you are likely to find a couple duplicates of the other two.</p>
		<p>This may seem like a lot, and it is. However, please note that the patterns are not BoP. So you can sell duplicates on the AH and use that gold to buy the ones you are missing, assuming there are multiple guilds preparing for AQ40 on your server. You may even be able to team up with another guild to swap duplicates, or to combine into farming for a single crafter.</p>
		<p>When purchasing a pattern on the AH you should consider the price of Encrypted Twilight Texts and determine whether it is worth your time/gold to farm them yourself or not. Ask your guild for help, it is quite unreasonable for a raid leader to expect you to do all of this alone.</p>
		<p>The best strategy is probably to find a Tailor for as many pieces as you can, then farm the missing patterns. As you can see this is quite an undertaking, so a Tailor is well justified in charging a crafting fee!</p>
		<p>The materials themself are not terribly expensive, although for a full set you will need 20 Dark Runes. Your guild may be able to help you out here. If they are expensive on the AH, and your guild doesn't have enough spare, form a Scholomance group in-guild and farm them. It should not take too much time. You can either do full runs, or likely more efficient route is clearing trash up to the Hatchlings then reset.</p>

    <section id="talents">
    	<h2>6. Talents</h2>
    	<p>There are many viable Talent builds, and what you use largely depends on:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Does your realm have Dual Specialization (e.g. Anniversary), and do you want to use it here?</li>
    		<li>Are you on a server with a debuff limit (e.g. old Classic Era)? Note that this is not a factor on any Hardcore realms, since there is no buff or debuff cap.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p><strong>Personally I run <a href="#talents-smruin">SM/Ruin</a></strong>, which is my standard Talent spec for HC raiding. We'll cover many builds, discussing their advantages and disadvantages. I have successfully tanked Twin Emps with all of these the specs listed here, and I am quite sure it would be possible to defeat the fight without a single Talent point spent!</p>
    	<p>If I was playing with Dual Spec, and was using it specifically for this fight alone, <strong>I would Dual Spec <a href="#talents-impimp">Imp Imp</a></strong>.</p>
    	<p>By far the most impactful Talent is <strong>Destructive Reach</strong>, for an extra 6 yds range on Searing Pain. Without it pulling Vek'lor at the start of the fight can be tricky, possibly resulting in an unexpected early pull. All of the talent builds shown here have 2/2 Destructive Reach.</p>

    	<h3 id="talents-smruin">6.1 SM/Ruin</h3>
    	<p>First let's look at my favourite build: <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0rVRboVZZxx0tMbz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SM/Ruin</a></p>
    	<figure id="fig19">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/talents/smruin.jpg" alt="The SM/Ruin Talents.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 19: The SM/Ruin Talents.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig19">Figure 19</a> shows a screenshot of the Talents. The core benefit of this build is that it allows us to run Imp. You'll want to keep your Imp Passive and Phase Shifted for Twins, and positioned as discussed in <a href="#positioning">Movement and Positioning</a>.</p>
    	<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>Blood Pact provides +42 Stam for both you and the Warrior tank.</strong> With world buffs (but not Kings) this is ~500 Health.</li>
    		<li><strong>5/5 Suppression gives +10% Spell Hit to Curse of Doom.</strong> Without this Curse of Doom is noticably more unreliable.</li>
    		<li><strong>It's an excellent HC raiding spec.</strong> You can use SM/Ruin as your main talent spec for HC raiding. In full BiS it is barely behind DS/Ruin on DPS (~3%), you get longer range on Curse, provide Blood Pact, and have a great build for open world content.</li>
    		<li><strong>Sufficient Threat output.</strong> While this isn't a Threat focused build, I have NEVER had Threat issues using SM/Ruin. It's important to note that while some other builds buff Searing Pain damage (i.e. Threat), they do not increase our Spell Hit. The build has no problem overcoming the Warrior threat. Outside of a fight with DPS pushing close on Threat meters in order to parse this has more than sufficient output.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>Not the highest Threat spec.</strong> We do have Ruin (crits do 2x damage), and 2/5 Improved Searing Pain (+4% Spell Crit). However, we do not take Demonic Sacrifice or Emberstorm, both of which are large Threat improvements. This can make a difference, especially if you are a fresh tank entering a raid with very geared DPS. However, it is the DPS's responsibility to ensure they do no rip threat.</li>
    		<li><strong>Not the highest Stam or SR spec.</strong> Our Blood Pact is great, but it is possible to get even more Stam from other builds. Through Master Demonologist it is also possible to gain an extra +60 SR. although that has its own drawbacks.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>Note that you may be unable to run this spec if you are on a realm with a debuff limit, and no Dual Spec, e.g. on old Classic Era servers. Without Dual Spec you'll have to run this for the entire raid, and outside of Twins this spec focuses on keeping up Corruption. Your raid may not allow a debuff slot for Corruption. That said, it would still function the same on Twin Emps.</p>

    	<h3 id="talents-dsruin">6.2 DS/Ruin</h3>
    	<p>Next let's look at <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZbxhzgboZxx0tMbz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DS/Ruin</a>.</p>
    	<figure id="fig20">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/talents/dsruin.jpg" alt="The DS/Ruin Talents.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 20: The DS/Ruin Talents.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>With this build we will not run a pet, instead we Demonic Sacrifice our Imp to increase our Searing Pain damage by 15%. Notice in <a href="#fig20">Figure 20</a> that we still have 9 talent points unspent. We have two choices:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Put them into Affliction to get Suppression, Improved Life Tap, and possibly Improved Corruption. This is the most common choice if this is your main DPS spec. For Twins this option will give extra Spell Hit for Curse of Doom.</li>
    		<li>Go deeper into Destruction to get 5/5 Emberstorm, further increasing our Searing Pain damage by another 10%. For Twins specifically this is the better choice, but you may prefer the former option if you use this spec on other fights.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>The +15% Stamina from Demonic Embrace is a lot.</strong> Let's consider the example T2 + Crafted SR set shown in <a href="#gearing-example">Example SR Sets</a>. We lose ~500 HP without Blood Pact, but we gain ~850 HP from 5/5 Demonic Embrace. Remember this is assuming world buffs but no Blessing of Kings. That's a net ~350 HP gain compared to SM/Ruin.</li>
    		<li><strong>Higher Searing Pain damage.</strong> Demonic Sacrifice is quite a substantial gain to our Threat. although not increasing the consistency in terms of Spell Hit it will make holding Threat easier. Emberstorm even more so.</li>
    		<li><strong>Improved Healthstone.</strong> This one is very minor, but if we do need to use our Healthstone we'll heal for a little bit more.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>No Blood Pact for the Warrior tank.</strong> Realistically, we have a much easier time surviving in this fight than the Warrior tank. Vek'nilash can deal a huge amount of damage, especially if it is your Warrior tank's first time tanking this it can be tough. You MUST discuss these options with your raid leader. Will the Warrior have enough HP without the +42 Stam from Blood Pact? Don't make this decision alone then surprise your raid on the day, especially in Hardcore.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>If you're playing with a debuff limit (not a factor in HC), then this is likely already your default Talent spec. If you're playing on a realm with Dual Spec then it can be a decent choice to swap to. Once again, it is important that your raid is aware that you will not be bringing Blood Pact for the fight. This build trades some party HP for a small personal HP gain and more Threat.</p>
    	<p>Note that if you have more than two Warlocks, a DPS Warlock could provide Blood Pact to mitigate this.</p>

    	<h3 id="talents-mdruin">6.3 MD/Ruin</h3>
    	<p>A classic spec for tanking Twin Emps is <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZbxuzgxoxZxx0tMbz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MD/Ruin</a>. The Talents themself are similar DS/Ruin, except with the 9 spare points used to unlock Master Demonologist - which means we will keep our pet out instead of Demonic Sacrifice.</p>
    	<figure id="fig21">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/talents/mdruin.jpg" alt="The MD/Ruin Talents.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 21: The MD/Ruin Talents.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>In <a href="#fig21">Figure 21</a> we see the MD/Ruin Talents. The crux of this spec is Master Demonologist, with it we will gain +60 SR just by having our Felhunter alive.</p>
    	<figure id="fig22">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/felhunter-position.jpg" alt="Felhunter Positioning.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 22: Example Felhunter postioning.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig22">Figure 22</a> shows an example of how you can position your Felhunter. In this example the Left Warlock mid-Vek'lor tanking phase, and the Right Warlock is waiting while their side's Warrior tanks Vek'nilash. While the Felhunter just needs to be alive, and within 100 yds to not despawn, to recieve the buff you have some considerations:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>It should be away from players, such that it is unlikely to be take damage from Blizzard or Explode Bug. The path DPS will move through is approximately shown by the blue shaded region. </li>
    		<li>It should be in range of the Healers on your side, just so they can heal it if it takes damage. If your Felhunter dies you will lose the +60 SR buff.</li>
    		<li>You should avoid positioning Felhunter on the stairs, or out of line-of-sight of the boss positions. It is rare but it has been suggested that a complex path between Vek'lor and any unit can trigger <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>You should position your Felhunter before the fight. <strong>It must be in both Stay and Passive modes. Be very careful of this.</strong> It's not uncommon to have Passive or Follow bound to a something easily misclicked, such as mouse wheel. If you accidentally make your Felhunter Follow you mid-tanking phase you will have no opportunity to reposition it until after Vek'lor Teleports away.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>If you make your Felhunter Follow by mistake, it is very likely to take Blizzard/Explode Bug damage and die.</li>
    		<li>Even worse if you accidentally set it to Attack or Defensive. It will run to attack Vek'lor which can both mess with initial Threat after teleport as well as potentially trigger <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>If your Felhunter dies, but Fel Domination is off CD, you can quickly resummon it using the following macro:</p>
    	<div class="code-block"><pre><code>#showtooltip Summon Felhunter
/cast [mod:shift] Fel Domination
/cast Summon Felhunter</code></pre></div>
		<p>With this macro holding Shift will automatically use Fel Domination for a faster resummon. Not using Shift will summon the pet normally, i.e. for setting up before the fight.</p>
		<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Master Demonologist gives +60 SR.</strong> If you're struggling with building your SR set, or were called up to tank last minute, this can be a huge help. It also gives the opportunity to focus more on Spell Hit and Stam, and can off-set the need to wear Engineer only Trinkets or the BoE SR Rings.</li>
			<li><strong>Demonic Embrace gives +15% Stam.</strong> As discussed in <a href="#talents-dsruin">DS/Ruin</a>.</li>
			<li><strong>Improved Healthstone.</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Plays like DS/Ruin for DPS fights.</strong> If you do not have Dual Spec, then for the other boss fights you can Demonic Sacrifice your Succubus and play the same way as DS/Ruin.</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Felhunter dying means -60 SR.</strong> This is a huge penalty. If your Felhunter dies you will suddenly start taking a lot more damage. <strong>It is crucial that you have over 210 SR without Felhunter</strong>, so that even if it dies you never take full damage Shadow Bolts. Make sure your healers are aware that they need to keep an eye on your pet's Health.</li>
			<li><strong>No Blood Pact for the Warrior tank.</strong> As with <a href="#talents-dsruin">DS/Ruin</a>, it is important that your Warrior tank and raid leader know that there will be no Blood Pact in the party.</li>
			<li><strong>No focus on Searing Pain improvements.</strong> This is relatively minor. It has the same Searing Pain output as <a href="#talents-smruin">SM/Ruin</a> and I have never struggled to hold Threat with that build.</li>
			<li><strong>No Suppression.</strong> I.e. you have no increase to Curse of Doom's Spell Hit to improve its consistency. Again, this is relatively minor.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Aside from the complications due to the Felhunter, this is a really good Talent build.</p>

    	<h3 id="talents-soullink">6.4 Soul Link</h3>
    	<p>The next spec we'll consider is <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IZbxuzgxotZxx0tMb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Soul Link</a>.</p>
    	<figure id="fig23">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/talents/soullink.jpg" alt="The Soul Link Talents.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 23: The Soul Link Talents.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig23">Figure 23</a> shows the Soul Link Talents. As you can see it is almost identical to <a href="#talents-mdruin">MD/Ruin</a> with one exception: Instead of taking Ruin we go one point deeper into Demonology for Soul Link. Without Ruin, your Searing Pain crits only deal 150% damage instead of 200% damage, however you gain a ton of extra mitigation. This is because 30% of all damage you take will instead be transferred to your Felhunter.</p>
    	<p>Let's return to the nightmare RNG, no protection potion or heals, combination we considered in the <a href="#gearing-stats">Stat Priority</a> section. Previously we suggested that a maximum damage Shadow Bolt, Blizzard tick, Explode Bug combo would deal ~8170 damage. <strong>With Soul Link you instead would take just ~5720 damage, with your Felhunter also taking ~2450 damage.</strong></p>
    	<p>This is a huge difference. However, your Felhunter will be taking constant damage through your tanking phase. This means that healers must focus on keeping it alive, splitting their heals 70/30 between you and the Felhunter.</p>
    	<p>Remember that Soul Link is not active by default. You will need to use the spell each time you summon your demon.</p>
    	<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Soul Link moves 30% of damage taken to your Felhunter.</strong> A huge level of mitigation, which can provide a big safety net in unlucky scenarios where you are hit with many mechanics in rapid succession.</li>
			<li><strong>Master Demonologist gives +60 SR.</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Demonic Embrace gives +15% Stam.</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Improved Healthstone.</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Felhunter dying means -60 SR AND losing Soul Link.</strong> This could be devastating, considering you could suddenly be taking 40-50% more damage. If your healers are not prepared this is a wild swing in incoming damage that can cause major issues.</li>
			<li><strong>Two targets to heal.</strong> Generally a good healer team with pet bars shown will not have trouble keeping the Felhunter alive. However, if you take multiple mechanics the healers should focus on keeping you alive, which may mean neglecting the also increased damage on your pet causing it to die.</li>
			<li><strong>No Blood Pact for the Warrior tank.</strong> It is important that your Warrior tank and raid leader know that there will be no Blood Pact in the party.</li>
			<li><strong>The lowest Threat spec here.</strong> Without Ruin this is by far the lowest Threat spec here. When overcoming the Warrior's initial Threat a crit can compensate for a resist, however this is much less of a factor without Ruin. Searing Pain Threat is still great, and so long as DPS are watching their Threat meters it should be fine once Threat is established. That reduced consistency after Teleport though can be quite noticable.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>While the extreme mitigation that Soul Link offers is enticing, I return to the core principles of this guide: Simplicity and consistency. When it works, it can be a huge help, however there are a lot more things to focus on with this spec which can make performing the fight more complex for both yourself and the healers. One thing I love about our strategy, combined with <a href="#talents-smruin">SM/Ruin</a>, is that it is extremely simple - for the most part you just stand there spamming Searing Pain while being bombed with heals.</p>

    	<h3 id="talents-impimp">6.5 Imp Imp</h3>
    	Finally, a Talent spec of my own machinations. <em>What if we took <a href="#talents-smruin">SM/Ruin</a> but removed all the points that are irrelevant to Twins and put them into things that are?</em> Et voilà, we have <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#Ix0bZfxhzZVx0tMxkx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imp Imp/Emberstorm</a>.
    	<figure id="fig24">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/talents/impimpemberstorm.jpg" alt="The Imp Imp/Emberstorm Talents.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 24: The Imp Imp/Emberstorm Talents.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig24">Figure 24</a> shows the Imp Imp/Emberstorm build. With this spec we run Imp for Blood Pact, however that Blood Pact is now +54 Stam due to 3/3 Improved Imp. We combine this with Demonic Embrace for even more Stamina. We still have Suppresion to increase the Curse of Doom consistency, but additionally we have 5/5 Improved Searing Pain and 5/5 Emberstorm to buff our Searing Pain Threat.</p>
    	<p>A very small trick, prior to <a href="#positioning-pull">The Pull</a>, that this spec enables for the Left Warlock is: Summon Voidwalker, Sacrifice him, Fel Domination, then Summon Imp. While this does provide an extra absorb shield, on top of Shadow Ward, it is extremely minor. Remember we have plenty of mitigation against Shadow Bolt so it is largely unnecessary. I would NOT recommend this trick in general, since it can overcomplicate the pull for a minor gain. Simple is safe. However, it is an option if you want to use it.</p>
    	<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The highest possible Stamina, with 3/3 Blood Pact and 5/5 Demonic Embrace.</strong> This provides both us, and the Warrior tank, with +54 Stam in addition to a +15% Stam increase for ourselves. Let's look back at the T2 + Crafted SR set shown in <a href="#gearing-example">Example SR Sets</a>. <strong>This puts us at over ~10100 Health!</strong> Compared to a case of no Blood Pact <em>and</em> no Demonic Embrace, this accounts for ~1600 HP (with world buffs, but no Kings).</li>
			<li><strong>+10% Searing Pain damage from Emberstorm.</strong> While not quite as large a damage buff as Demonic Sacrifice, this is still a noticable increase.</li>
			<li><strong>5/5 Suppression.</strong> +10% Spell Hit for Curse of Doom, making it less likely to resist.</li>
			<li><strong>Improved Healthstone.</strong></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Highly tailored for Twin Emps.</strong> Outside of Twin Emps this isn't a good DPS build.</li>
			<li><strong>No increase to SR.</strong> Does not provide Master Demonologist for the +60 SR bonus.</li>
			<li><strong>Not quite the highest Threat spec.</strong> While Emberstorm is good it is not quite as high of a Searing Pain buff as is possible from <a href="#talents-dsruin">DS/Ruin.</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>If I was using this spec just for Twins, it would easily be my number one choice.</strong> If you're respeccing specifically for this fight, or you want to use your Dual Spec just for Twins, it can be an excellent choice.</p>
		<p>There is also a more widely applicable version of this spec, that goes deeper into Affliction but doesn't take Emberstorm, <a href="https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IE0bVMbZsxZxx0tMbz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Imp Imp/Utility.</a></p>
    	<figure id="fig25">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/talents/impimputility.jpg" alt="The Imp Imp/Utility Talents.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 25: The Imp Imp/Utility Talents.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig25">Figure 25</a> shows the Utility variant of the Imp Imp spec. This spec is one that I often recommend to beginner Hardcore 60 Warlocks who are less concerned with damage and want to just survive dungeon grinding and their first few raids. It plays just like <a href="#talents-smruin">SM/Ruin</a> just taking Improved Imp and Demonic Embrace instead of Shadow Mastery. With 5/5 Fel Concentration it is also viable for open world mob grinding.</p>
    	<p>Aside from lacking the Searing Pain damage buff from Emberstorm, this has all the other advantages of the Imp Imp/Emberstorm variant. For Twins specifically it is still superior to SM/Ruin due to the much increased Stamina. If you want a more general Dual Spec, that can provide your party with Improved Imp on other fights too, then this can be a good choice.</p>
    	<p>A small thing to note: If you had 0/3 Improved Imp then swap to these talents you will need to click Blood Pact twice - disable then enable it. I have noticed this bug sometimes, where without toggling it the Imp is providing the unimproved version. Frustratingly the buff's tooltip always shows +42 Stam, but you can verify that it is working by looking at your Stamina in the Character pane.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="melee-mode">
    	<h2>7. Melee Mode</h2>
    	<p>Melee Mode is a phenomenon where Vek'lor runs forward to melee the player, instead of standing still casting Shadow Bolt. Typically he will first run forwards Arcane Burst, which is actually the optimal outcome for us as the Warlock tank. These melee attacks can hit quite hard, if it crits you it can hit for ~6000 damage. You can see how this combined with a ~4000 damage Arcane Burst can potentially be lethal. Hence our decision to always have a GAPP up before the fight, despite this being a very rare mechanic. Following the strategy outlined in this guide I almost never see Melee Mode, but it does happen perhaps 1 in 20 fights.</p>

    	<h3 id="melee-mode-causes">7.1 Known Causes</h3>
    	<p><strong>Being too close to Vek'lor.</strong> The first, and most common, cause of Melee Mode is a player being too close to the boss. Usually this is the Warrior tank failing to immediately move far enough from Vek'lor immediately after the Teleport. This means being outside of not just melee range but also Arcane Burst range (10 yds). In fact, 10 yds is not always enough. The Warrior can run back to a similar distance as you as a guide. If a player is a little outside of Arcane Burst range then Vek'lor my walk forward and use the spell. A useful comparison are the caster mobs in WPL and EPL. They have a complex AI that will rarely move closer to Frost or Fire Nova you.</p>

		</figure>
		<p><a href="#vid5">Video 5</a> shows an example of this. As we see here it's not just about top Threat being too close. <strong>Anyone being too close can cause Melee Mode, including pets.</strong> This is why it is vital your pet is on Passive, and you don't accidentally send them in to attack. This is particularly important for Felhunter builds, since the Felhunter will run into melee if it is on Defensive.</p>
		<p><em>If you have any further knowledge on Melee Mode, or some good clips of it happening, please reach out to me so I can expand this section!</em></p>
		<p><strong>Outranging Shadow Bolt.</strong> Vek'lor's Shadow Bolt has a range of 45 yds. If you outrange it he will of course chase you, however he won't necessarily stop and begin casting once in range. Often he will enter Melee Mode instead. Our strategy involves never repositioning Vek'lor - all repositioning is done by the Warrior tanking Vek'nilash. This means as the Warlock tank you should never be the cause of this, we avoid mechanics in a circular arc that keeps our distance to Vek'lor roughly constant.</p>
		<p>What you cannot personally control are DPS who keep attacking Vek'lor right up until Teleport, or leave big hitting DoTs like Ignite rolling. A spell in mid-flight, or one that batches with Teleport, will hit Vek'lor after he reappears. This can cause someone on the opposite side of the room to be top Threat after Teleport, thus causing him to chase them. This is why it is vital that all DoTs expire before the Teleport window opens, and once the window is open everyone (including the Warlock tank) stops attacking him.</p>
		<p>The only time I would ever reconsider repositioning Vek'lor as the Warlock tank is if he was within the Heal Brother range of Vek'nilash. This is extremely unlikely however as he would need to have moved very far out of position to be within 60 yds of the other boss.</p>
		<p><strong>Vanish, Feign Death, or Petri, during Teleport.</strong> A quirk of many Vanilla WoW encounters is the use of a hidden NPC to trigger mechanics for the fight. Sometimes referred to as the "Third Twin", there is an invisible unit under the map, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/npc=15695/vek-twins-trigger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vek Twins Trigger</a>, which handles the Threat mechanic for Teleport. It is advised that no one uses Vanish, Feign Death, or Flask of Petrification, during the Teleport window since if it overlaps the Teleport it can cause issues. I have never actually seen this myself, however I am told on good authority that it can happen. For safety I recommend against the use of these abilities, and certainly not inside the Teleport window.</p>
		<p>What I have experienced numerous times on non-Hardcore is a player being dead during the Teleport, then revived through Rebirth, Ankh, or Soulstone. If you're dead during the Teleport your Threat may not be reset, meaning when revived you are likely to have a lot of Threat on the boss. When I was first learning Twin Emps, back in 2020, I successfully used this to recover a pull - I had died fighting Vek'lor but waited until the next time he was on my side to use my Soulstone.</p>
		<p><strong>Evading the boss.</strong> While this has never been confirmed, it is widely reported that people have had far fewer instances of Melee Mode by avoiding having anyone (certaintly the tanks) standing on the stairs by the room's entrance. This makes some intuitive sense: If the boss cannot path to you he may behave strangely. While I have never seen definitive proof that the stairs cause Melee Mode, I do know that they can cause line-of-sight issues between a until downstairs one one on the upper level by the wall. I personally use this to avoid the Fear effect when the post-Twins Qiraji Mindslayers die. Nonetheless, our strategy doesn't actually have anyone on the stairs, so this is not an issue.</p>

    	<h3 id="melee-mode-recovery">7.2 Recovery</h3>
    	<p>To exit Melee Mode you are going to need to try to be an appropriate distance from Vek'lor that allows you to tank the boss. You may have to run away to avoid being hit in melee multiple times. You should <strong>NEVER Petri while tanking Vek'lor</strong>. This will wipe your Threat, and it's unlikely that you will be able to recover during this tanking phase. The only exception would be if your raid leader calls for everyone to Petri.</p>
    	<p><strong>The first thing to consider is where the Arcane Burst is going to send you.</strong> You should be aware of this so you are not trapped in a corner.</p>
    	<figure id="fig26">

    		<figcaption>Fig 26: Preparing for Arcane Burst.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>In <a href="#fig26">Figure 26</a> we see a case where the Warrior tank has triggered Melee Mode by being too close to Vek'lor. As soon as you notice that the boss is in Melee Mode (moving) you should focus on where an Arcane Burst will knock you:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>The white arrow shows the direction Vek'lor is moving.</li>
    		<li>The dotted line marks the edge of the ramp.</li>
    		<li>The shaded red region is where you do NOT want to be sent. You can get trapped in this corner between the wall and the ramp.</li>
    		<li>The green arrow shows an optimal Arcane Burst knockback, sending us up onto the ramp, and importantly not into the red region.</li>
    		<li>The purple arrow is how I would move if I noticed Melee Mode. I am moving laterally so that I am knocked onto the ramp instead of into the corner.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>The main focus here is to not be knocked into the corner between the wall and the ramp. This is a bad place to be:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>The edge of the ramp may break line-of-sight from your healers.</li>
    		<li>You will have to move all the way through Vek'lor to leave melee range.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>In my opinion being knocked up onto the stairs is a decent option, since your healers have clear line-of-sight to you. You are also not bringing Vek'lor into melee range with the DPS group.</p>

		</figure>
		<p>At roughly the 11 second timestamp in <a href="#vid6">Video 6</a> we see an example of Arcane Burst knocking the Warlock tank up onto the ramp. This was a particularly challenging example of Melee Mode, where the boss melees the Warlock prior to the Arcane Burst.</p>
		<p>Often, Arcane Burst will send you to a distance that is reasonable to tank the boss at. In many cases the Melee Mode will end here, and you can simply remain in your new position and continue tanking the boss.</p>
		<p><strong>DPS stop, and leave melee range.</strong> Having to overcome DPS that are still pumping, or are within melee range, is too much to ask of a Warlock tank trying to get Vek'lor to exit Melee Mode. However, if a DPS is close on Threat and the correct distance to tank Vek'lor they could purposefully overtake Threat in an attempt to temporarily take over as the tank. <strong>Generally, I do NOT recommend this.</strong> The intention must be clearly communicated to the raid, and you must be tanky enough to survive. The primary issue here is that so much is already going on, and people are likely panicking. Adding another person into this can make communication difficult, and its also adding in another person to heal. Ideally the healers are focused on bombing all possible heals into the Warlock tank during these crucial moments.</p>
		<p><strong>LIP then cancel it.</strong> An option that has worked well in the past to force Vek'lor back into casting Shadow Bolt is to Limited Invulnerability Potion, and then cancel it almost immediately afterwards. You can remove LIP by right-clicking the buff off, or by using:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><code>/cancelaura Invulnerability</code></pre></div>
		<p>This works because usually Vek'lor will target the 2nd Threat player when you LIP. Assuming they are at the correct distance, Vek'lor will likely exit Melee Mode and decide to Shadow Bolt them. <strong>You must cancel this quickly.</strong> Worst case scenario the DPS player takes 1 Shadow Bolt, you must not let them take multiple. Be ready to cancel before you use the LIP.</p>
		<p>Notice I say "usually". The interaction of LIP is somewhat inconsistent with Vek'lor, and I believe the outcome may depend on what he is doing at the instance that you use it:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>He targets a new player and starts casting Shadow Bolt at them. This is the most common outcome that I have seen.</li>
			<li>He exits Melee Mode but continues to cast Shadow Bolt at you. This was an unexpected result but I have had it personally happen on two occasions.</li>
			<li>He continues to Melee you despite you having LIP up. We see this happen in <a href="#vid6">Video 6</a>.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>I consider LIP a <strong>last resort</strong>. You can first see if Arcane Burst allows you to land in a new tanking position that causes Vek'lor to exit Melee Mode first.</p>
		<p><strong>Greater Stoneshield and tank some hits.</strong> I did not include Greater Stoneshield Potion in the <a href="#consumables">Consumable List</a> since I generally thing LIP into immediately cancelling it is a better option. However, you could choose to Stoneshield in order to stay top Threat on Vek'lor. This is the potion equivalent of putting on a Shield, and it is a decent amount of mitigation. That said, Vek'lor hits very hard so even with Stoneshield it's going to be hard to heal you through it. Thankfully Vek'lor has a reasonable swing timer, I believe it is ~1.9s, so if healers are bombing you with heals you should be able to tank a couple of hits.</p>
		<p><strong>Ensure the Warrior tank is closest to Vek'lor before Teleport.</strong> It is very likely that your new tanking position is much closer to Vek'lor when he exits Melee Mode than you are used to. It is vitally important that the Warrior is closer once the Teleport window opens. You may have to adjust to move back slightly to allow the Warrior to get closer, however I would advise not moving too much once you have him in a position that is working. Remember, the boss will do nothing for 1-2s after Teleport. Use this time to get away.</p>
		<p>In <a href="#vid6">Video 6</a> we see that the Warlock tank is closer than the Warrior when Teleport occurs. Vek'nilash targets the Warlock hits them three times, each for ~2000-3000 damage (non-crit). If this happens you should immediately LIP. If LIP is on CD from the previous phase you should Petri, with the video showing a great example of this. If Vek'nilash uses Unbalancing Strike on you then there is a good chance you will be one-shot.</p>

    <section id="pushback">
    	<h2>8. Spell Pushback Analysis</h2>
    	<p>A common question is: Should we use Concentration Aura, or the PVP gloves, to mitigate spell pushback? The answer may surprise you, <strong>I recommend running 0% spell pushback mitigation!</strong> Before we discuss that, let's briefly explain what spell pushback is.</p>
    	<p>The first time you are hit while casting a spell, your cast time will be reset by some amount:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>If you are over 1s into a cast, then your cast bar will be "pushed back" by 1s. For example, if you are hit 1.3s into casting Searing Pain you will be rest back to 0.3s into the cast.</li>
    		<li>If you are under 1s into a cast, then your cast bar will be reset to zero. For example, if you are hit 0.1s into casting Searing Pain you will be reset back to the beginning of the cast.</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>The second hit will instead push you back by just 0.8s, the third by 0.6s, the next by 0.4s, the next by 0.2s. However, since Vek'lor's Shadow Bolt cast time is 1.6s, which is higher than our Searing Pain cast time of 1.5s, we only need to consider the case where we are hit once during the cast (1s pushback).</p>
    	<p>We have the following ways to gain a chance to resist the spell pushback effect:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=19746/concentration-aura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concentration Aura</a>:</strong> Untalented this gives a 35% chance for party members to ignore spell pushback.</li>
    		<li><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/spell=20256/improved-concentration-aura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Improved Concentration Aura</a>:</strong> At 3/3 Talent points this increases the pushback resistance chance to 50%.</li>
    		<li><strong><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/item=17564/knight-lieutenants-dreadweave-gloves" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warlock PVP Gloves</a>:</strong> 50% chance for Searing Pain to ignore pushback resistance. Available at PVP Rank 7, with a higher quality version (with the same effect) unlocked at Rank 12.</li>

    	</ul>

    	<h3 id="pushback-results">8.1 Results</h3>
    	<p>The results here are perhaps unintuitive until you think about it:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li><strong>The best setup is both Improved Concentration Aura AND PVP gloves.</strong> This gives a 100% chance to ignore spell pushback.</li>
    		<li><strong>The second best is to use neither!</strong> That is, do NOT use any form of Concentration Aura and do NOT use the PVP gloves.* Having 0% pushback resistance is better than having a partial chance.</li>
    		<li><strong>The worst setup is any combination that does not reach 100% pushback resistance.</strong></li>
    	</ul>
    	<p><strong>With zero pushback resistance your cast time syncs with Vek'lors</strong>, meaning that after the first few casts <strong>your effective Searing Pain cast time becomes 1.6s</strong>. That is just a 0.1s increase, or ~6.7%, which is very minor.</p>
    	<p>For Horde the choice is simple, you don't have Paladins, so do NOT wear the PVP gloves. This is also true for Alliance on Hardcore servers where the PVP gloves are unavailable.</p>
    	<p>For Alliance on non-Hardcore servers you can choose to wear the PVP gloves, so long as your party's Paladin has 3/3 Improved Concentration Aura. This can be a good choice for improving the consistency with which you overtake the Warrior tank's initial Threat. However, do note that it requires you to wear the PVP gloves instead of something like T0.5 Gloves.</p>
    	<p><strong>This means that our Paladin can keep up Devotion Aura to provide extra mitigation for us during <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a>, as well as for the Warrior tanking Vek'nilash.</strong></p>
    	<p><em>*There is a case to be made for the 85% pushback resistance from untalented Concentration Aura and PVP gloves, with a lower average cast time than 1.6s. However, given how minor the benefit is I would not use this combination, especially since it is still capable of suffering from bad RNG.</em></p>


    	<h3 id="pushback-explanation">8.2 Explanation</h3>
    	<p>First we'll discuss the theory behind why this is.</p>
    	<figure id="fig27">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/pushback-theory.jpg" alt="Theoretical Spell Pushback.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 27: Theoretical Spell Pushback.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig27">Figure 27</a> shows spell pushback suffered by successive Searing Pain casts assuming Vek'lor's Shadow Bolt first hits us 1.3s into our cast. The red crosses indicate cast bars that will be pushed back, the green checkmarks indicate bars that will complete their cast. A green bar indicates the current cast progress, and a faint red bar the cast time lost due to the last pushback.</p>
    	<p>If Shadow Bolt hits us at over 1s into our cast (e.g. Cast 1), on the next cast we will be hit again but at under 1s (e.g. Cast 2). Once we have suffered pushback less than 1s into our cast, all successive casts will now always recieve pushback 0.1s in (e.g. Casts 3 and 4). At that point, assuming we do not stop spamming Searing Pain, we will suffer exactly 0.1s of pushback on each cast; i.e. our effective cast time will be 1.6s (the same as Vek'lor's). Depending on the timing of when the first Shadow Bolt lands, we will suffer a larger pushback on our first 1-2 casts, but all casts after that will take 1.6s.</p>
    	<p>To explore this further I wrote a simple MATLAB simulation of the fight. First we'll test our hypothesis, by considering the case with zero pushback resistance.</p>
    	<figure id="fig28">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/matlab/0-pushback-fixed.jpg" alt="0% pushback cast times.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 28: Cast times for 0% pushback resistance, and exactly 1.6s Vek'lor cast time.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>In <a href="#fig28">Figure 28</a> we see the results of 1000 iterations of the simulation. The timing for the initial Shadow Bolt hitting us is randomly chosen each interation. We see that by ~3 casts we are synced with the boss's 1.6s cast time. The small variations are due to the the 1% base chance to resist a Shadow Bolt that we always have.</p>
    	<p>However, Vek'lor occasionally pauses, taking very slightly more than 1.6s to cast. This will cause higher and more inconsistent pushback. We should model this. To model the variation in Shadow Bolt timing I used a half normal distribution and with a standard deviation of 0.02s and a maximum cast delay of 0.1s.</p>
    	<figure id="fig29">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/matlab/0-pushback-variable.jpg" alt="0% pushback cast times, with variable Veklor casts.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 29: Cast times for 0% pushback resistance, and variable Vek'lor cast time.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p><a href="#fig29">Figure 29</a> shows the results after introducing this variable Shadow Bolt timing, for 1000 iterations. Looking just at casts after the first 3, i.e. after syncing, we had:</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Mean Cast Time: 1.6002s</li>
    		<li>Standard Deviation: 0.0188s</li>
    		<li>Minimum Cast Time: 1.5s</li>
    		<li>Maximum Cast Time: 1.8s</li>
    		<li>Median Absolute Deviation: 0.0111s, this will be a useful comparison later when we see that other pushback resistances give multimodal distributions.</li>
    		<li>Average Cast Time for 3 Consecutive Casts: 1.6000s</li>
    	</ul>
    	<figure id="fig30">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/matlab/35-pushback-variable.jpg" alt="35% pushback cast times, with variable Veklor casts.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 30: Cast times for 35% pushback resistance, and variable Vek'lor cast time.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Let's instead now consider the case of using just the standard Concentration Aura, i.e. a 35% chance of pushback resistance. The results are shown in <a href="#fig30">Figure 30</a>, and we see there are huge inconsistencies in cast times. The result is a multimodal distribution, representing the number of times we resisted a Shadow Bolt before finally taking pushback. Of course, ~35% of casts are 1.5s. However, the pushback resistance means we do not sync up with the boss's cast and so can suffer pushback much later in the cast. This results in much longer effective cast times.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Mean Cast Time: 1.6047s</li>
    		<li>Standard Deviation: 0.1098s</li>
    		<li>Minimum Cast Time: 1.5s</li>
    		<li>Maximum Cast Time: 2.5s</li>
    		<li>Median Absolute Deviation: 0.0777s</li>
    		<li>Average Cast Time for 3 Consecutive Casts: 1.6009s</li>
    	</ul>
    	<figure id="fig31">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/matlab/50-pushback-variable.jpg" alt="50% pushback cast times, with variable Veklor casts.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 31: Cast times for 50% pushback resistance, and variable Vek'lor cast time.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Next we'll look at 50% pushback resistance. This is equivalent to just running PVP gloves and no Paladin Aura, or just running 3/3 Improved Concentration Aura without the gloves. The results are shown in <a href="#fig31">Figure 31</a>. We see the same effect here as for 35%. Yes ~50% of the casts are 1.5s, however the times that we do not ignore pushback have hugely inconsistent cast times.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Mean Cast Time: 1.6053s</li>
    		<li>Standard Deviation: 0.1458s</li>
    		<li>Minimum Cast Time: 1.5s</li>
    		<li>Maximum Cast Time: 2.5s</li>
    		<li>Median Absolute Deviation: 0.1070s</li>
    		<li>Average Cast Time for 3 Consecutive Casts: 1.6013s</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>An important note here is that for 35% pushback, ~16.9% of casts were longer than 1.7s. For 50% pushback, ~19.7% were longer than 1.7s. This makes sense when we remember that if a cast suffers pushback over 1s into the cast, then on the next cast we will be hit much earlier (at under 1s) into the cast. If we ignore pushback when it would have otherwise only recieved a small penalty it results in a much larger penalty next time. We are next hit when we are late in the cast again.</p>
    	<figure id="fig32">
    		<img class="center-img" src="assets/twins/matlab/85-pushback-variable.jpg" alt="85% pushback cast times, with variable Veklor casts.">
    		<figcaption>Fig 32: Cast times for 85% pushback resistance, and variable Vek'lor cast time.</figcaption>
    	</figure>
    	<p>Finally the 85% pushback resistance case, where we have untalented Concentration Aura combined with the PVP gloves. The results are shown in <a href="#fig32">Figure 32</a>. The left graph, showing all 1000 trials, is difficult to interpret. The key thing to notice is that as we increase the pushback resistance the density of lines that are in the 1.6s cast time range gets less and less. The syncing effect was still observable in some trials previously, whereas at this point it is almost entirely gone. As seen in the histogram, we still have an inconsistency in our casts, but as expected only ~15% of casts are greater than 1.5s.</p>
    	<ul>
    		<li>Mean Cast Time: 1.5701s</li>
    		<li>Standard Deviation: 0.2006s</li>
    		<li>Minimum Cast Time: 1.5s</li>
    		<li>Maximum Cast Time: 2.5s</li>
    		<li>Median Absolute Deviation: 0.1195s</li>
    		<li>Average Cast Time for 3 Consecutive Casts: 1.5700s</li>
    	</ul>
    	<p>This is the first time that we actually have an average cast time that is below 1.6s. The deviation shows that the unresisted pushback is still resulting in wildly inconsistent cast times, however it is such a minority of the Searing Pain casts that it is less relevant. That said, with this setup it is still possible to get very bad RNG and have a string of casts with a high average cast time.</p>
    	<p>The 100% pushback resistance case is trivial, 100% of your Searing Pain casts are 1.5s. Personally I feel that the benefit from any of these partial, or full, pushback mitigation setups is so minor as to not be worthwhile. I feel that the 35% and 50% cases are clearly worse than 0%, and the benefit from 85% and 100% is very small. Realistically the benefit is not going to change whether you successfully defeat Twin Emps. Having Devotion Aura up is far more impactful, since the Warrior's tanking phase and the rare <a href="#melee-mode">Melee Mode</a> are the real difficult part of this fight.</p>
