        <h2>0. Preface</h2>
        <h3 id="preface-goal">0.1 The Goal of This Guide</h3>
        <p>The novelty of a Warlock tank has made Twim Emps a highly discussed fight. However, in my experience, it is by far the most consistent and easy role in the fight. That said it is incredibly fun!</p>
        <p>The primary goal of this guide is to coach anyone to be capable of performing the role in Hardcore, even if they have zero prior experience with AQ40 in any capacity. It provides a step-by-step explanation of how to perform the fight, as well as everything you need to know to prepare ahead of time.</p>
        <p>The nature of Hardcore demands consistent strategies that work on the first try. For that reason, the same strategies can be applied by non-Hardcore (softcore) guilds who are progressing the fight. It is not the task of this guide to discuss parse strategies, instead aiming an extremely simple, repeatable, methodology with as little movement and intricacy as possible.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there are several non-trivial questions on which I hope to share my knowledge. In particular the matters of spell pushback mitigation, and Vek'lor's melee mode. The latter of which is still not fully understood.</p>
        <h3 id="preface-about">0.2 About the Author</h3>
        <p>Who is esuvii? In short, I love HC WoW and my favourite class is Warlock! I played Warlock through 2019 Classic, TBC and WotLK. In mid-late 2020, I first tried Hardcore, largely inspired by watching B0aty play HCIM OSRS I attempted (and succeeded) to level a HC Hunter to 60. Later I began to actively play as a member of the Classic Hardcore community, and in November 2021 I joined the HC Road to Ragnaros event in Season of Mastery. Ever since then I've been raiding as a Warlock in HC Elite.</p>
        <p>As of writing this, I've played Warlock on Twins Emps a minimum of:</p>
        <ul>
        	<li>32 times in softcore.</li>
        	<li>12 times in unofficial HC on BSB (including the first ever clear).</li>
        	<li>73 times in official HC on Defias Pillager (including the world first official clear).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>During this time I have coached several Warlocks to tank Twins in HC, including those with zero experience.</p>
        <p><strong>We have NEVER had a Warlock tank die on Twins.</strong></p>
        <p>Through HC I have tanked in a BWL level SR set, absolute BiS SR gear, fresh 60 + crafted SR gear, and one time when I forgot to equip SR gear.</p>
        <p><em>While there is no single highest authority on this fight, I believe there is a strong case that I have the most HC experience.</em></p>

    	<h2>1. The Basics</h2>
    	<p>Twin Emporers, as the name suggests, is a fight with two bosses: Vek'lor (caster boss), and Vek'nilash (melee boss). It is a required boss, situated after Huhuran, and opens the door which leads to Ouro and C'thun.</p>
